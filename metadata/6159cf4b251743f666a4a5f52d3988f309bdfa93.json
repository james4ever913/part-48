Braumeister Smith (Max von Sydow) has a plan to take over the world with his new brew, and only the Great White hosers of the North, Bob and Doug McKenzie (Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas) -- with their plaid shirts, ski toques, fur-lined parkas, and addiction to beer -- can stop the dastardly plan, sober or not. There are several jabs at &quot;hoseheads&quot; and the business of movie-making, including an epilogue that critiques the film itself. Strange Brew found a cult audience with fans of the Second City comedy troupe, of which Moranis and Thomas were members.\n\n****************************************************************************************\n\n\nThis is one killer movie! ;-)\n\n\n***************************************************************************************\n\n\nFREE THE WEED!!!!\n\nwww.norml.com\n\n\n**************************************************************************************","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6159cf4b251743f666a4a5f52d3988f309bdfa93","amp;dn":"Strange+Brew","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6159cf4b251743f666a4a5f52d3988f309bdfa93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,89,207,75,37,23,67,246,102,164,165,245,45,57,136,243,9,189,250,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
