(Full length)\n\nIMDB rating: 9.1\n\nJourneying through inner cities, suburbs, plains and desert, Lawn and Order is a fun, hilarious and touching documentary which reveals the zany and obsessive fascination North Americans have with their front yard. Using twinges of black humour, the immediacy of cinema veritÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© and the occasional dramatic re-enactment, the film drops in on everyone from the proud home-owning suburbanite to the eccentric inner-city lawn rebel as they share with us why they do what they do with their front yard. Often a battleground, the front yard is the site of fascinating human drama and conflict involving issues of individual rights and freedoms versus community standards and norms. After seeing Lawn and Order you will never look at a front yard the same way!\n\nDecent quality transfer from VHS, mono audio.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26b0efb615b02248f6d64c75cf5bf65191c29bad","amp;dn":"Lawn+and+Order+%281994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26b0efb615b02248f6d64c75cf5bf65191c29bad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,176,239,182,21,176,34,72,246,214,76,117,207,91,246,81,145,194,155,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
