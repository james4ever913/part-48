From the pure, unrelentic assault of &quot;Train Wreckage on the Underground Railroad&quot; to the hooking, demonic harmonics on &quot;Uncle Toms Cabin On Fire&quot; - you know this is Black Metal like you have never heard it. Forget those riffs Euronymous wrote, Sir Reginald and Seamus DeVille cook up far better riffs. Check out the two songs I just mentioned, plus &quot;Kall of the Kvlt Klux Klan&quot; and &quot;Abraham Lincoln, I Fucking Hate You&quot; to see what I mean. The guitars are hard hitting, sonically menacing, and well-executed. High-rung harmonics can be heard, and there are alot of tremolo-picking sections. \n\nThis is a release worth downloading no matter what your taste in music is.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7c4086b060b9f117418488a01b2dad79766ef03","amp;dn":"Slave+Whipping+Blasphemy+-+A+Kall+To+Whips","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7c4086b060b9f117418488a01b2dad79766ef03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,196,8,107,6,11,159,17,116,24,72,138,1,178,218,215,151,102,239,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
