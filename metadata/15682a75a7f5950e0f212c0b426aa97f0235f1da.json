Between 1991 and 2003 they recorded six studio albums, in addition to charting fourteen singles on the Billboard country charts. Their highest-peaking American single was 1996's &quot;All You Ever Do Is Bring Me Down&quot;, a collaboration with accordionist Flaco JimÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©nez.\nAfter the band split up in 2003, lead singer Raul Malo became a solo artist. Robert Reynolds has released two solo EPs, 'Audrey In A Dream' &amp; 'The Wintersky Works', co-founded a 'sort-of-supergroup' called SWAG - releasing the album Catchall, and performs with fellow member Paul Deakin in various groups. Occasional supporting member, guitarist and songwriter Jamie Hanna, joined Jonathan McEuen in the duo Hanna-McEuen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15682a75a7f5950e0f212c0b426aa97f0235f1da","amp;dn":"The+Mavericks+-+All+You+Ever+Do+Is+Bring+Me+Down+%28MPG%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15682a75a7f5950e0f212c0b426aa97f0235f1da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,104,42,117,167,245,149,14,15,33,44,11,66,106,169,127,2,53,241,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
