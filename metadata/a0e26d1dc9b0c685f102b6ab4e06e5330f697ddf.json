With the whole nation watching, he is just one question \naway from winning a staggering 20 million rupees on India's &quot;Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?&quot; But when the show \nbreaks for the night, police arrest him on suspicion of cheating; how could a street kid know so much? Desperate \nto prove his innocence, Jamal tells the story of his life in the slum where he and his brother grew up, of their \nadventures together on the road, of vicious encounters with local gangs, and of Latika, the girl he loved and lost. \nEach chapter of his story reveals the key to the answer to one of the game show's questions. Each chapter of \nJamal's increasingly layered story reveals where he learned the answers to the show's seemingly impossible quizzes. \nBut one question remains a mystery: what is this young man with no apparent desire for riches really doing on the \ngame show? When the new day dawns and Jamal returns to answer the final question, the Inspector and sixty million \nviewers are about to find out. At the heart of its storytelling lies the question of how anyone comes to know the \nthings they know about life and love.\n\nCast : \nDev Patel ... Jamal K. Malik\nAnil Kapoor ...
