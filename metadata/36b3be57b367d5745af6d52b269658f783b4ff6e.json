He loves me not.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ WouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t it be great if there was a formula to get your partner to commit? Josie has been dating Curry for more than three years, and she says sheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ready to dump him if he doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t pop the question soon. Curry says he loves his girlfriend, so why is he afraid to walk down the aisle? Will Josie hold out for a ring, or will she kick this commitment-phobe to the curb? Then, Melissa thought she had it all ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“- the ring, the dress and the man of her dreams ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“- until she discovered her wedding was a sham. She says her husband, John, lied about how many times heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d been married, but the biggest tale of all is that heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s still married to another woman! John admits that he lied about being divorced, but says Melissa wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have stayed with him if he told her the truth. Will Melissa ever be able to trust him again ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and should she? Plus, meet a couple who says their dream wedding turned into a nightmare when the wedding planner scammed them out of $30,000.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36b3be57b367d5745af6d52b269658f783b4ff6e","amp;dn":"Dr.Phil.Show.2010.12.06.Commit.Or.Quit.HDTV.x264-NBC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36b3be57b367d5745af6d52b269658f783b4ff6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,179,190,87,179,103,213,116,90,246,213,43,38,150,88,247,131,180,255,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
