It spans seven pages, includes 300 (yes, 300) pics, and required nearly four hundred tons of concrete.  The result was the biggest and best list we&amp;#039;ve done so far.  By far.\n\nEach of us (including our two new writers, Mark and Emily) have compiled a list, complete with pictures, of the women we would most like to shake hands with fuck.  Be sure to click on the pics; they&amp;#039;ll take you to a larger version.\n\nWhat?  We&amp;#039;ve sold out, you say?  We&amp;#039;ve sacrificed our trademark wit for scantily clad ladies?  We&amp;#039;re ripping ideas from magazines written by queers who wear cologne, such as FHM or Maxim?  Well, true.  But we&amp;#039;ve got one thing they don&amp;#039;t have.\n\nWait, no we don&amp;#039;t.  Enjoy the list.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c43fba9c60286fca85b1727d00ebecd1567702a9","amp;dn":"FHM+Spain+-+100+Sexiest+Women+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c43fba9c60286fca85b1727d00ebecd1567702a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,63,186,156,96,40,111,202,133,177,114,125,0,235,236,209,86,119,2,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
