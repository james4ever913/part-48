It is the last release by the band to feature their metalcore sound, although more clean vocals are featured on the album than their debut album, Sounding the Seventh Trumpet.\n\nWaking the Fallen was Avenged Sevenfold's first album to feature bassist Johnny Christ as well as the first to feature the full current line-up (up until The Rev's death), after Dameon Ash's Departure. The album was certified gold on July 15, 2009.\n\nA live performance video was shot at Warped Tour 2003 for the first single from Waking the Fallen, &quot;Second Heartbeat&quot;. A video was made for the second single &quot;Unholy Confessions&quot; on March 6, 2004. It was a live video with the actual track dubbed over. It featured the fans before and during an Avenged Sevenfold concert. According to vocalist M. Shadows, it was requested by their new label, Warner Bros. Records in order to publicize the band before their 2005 album City of Evil.\n\nThis video was the second attempt at a video for the track. The previous attempt was a concept video created the previous fall (2003). The band was not happy with the final product, however, and opted to re-shoot the video, this time as a live performance. The new video went into rotation on MTV2's Headbanger's Ball.\n\nWaking the Fallen received a positive profile in Billboard, with the magazine comparing Avenged Sevenfold to bands like NOFX, Iron Maiden, and Metallica. In other profiles, the album also received comparisons to the Misfits and further comparisons to Iron Maiden. &quot;Chapter Four&quot; was featured in NASCAR Thunder 2004, Madden 2004 and NHL 2004, which garnered enough exposure to lead to a record deal with Warner Bros. Records. This record is also notable among fans because of M. Shadows' slightly higher voice and high notes he sings on songs like &quot;I Won't See You Tonight&quot; (both parts).\n\nAvenged Sevenfold is an American rock band from Huntington Beach, California, formed in 1999. The band consists of vocalist M. Shadows, lead guitarist Synyster Gates, rhythm guitarist Zacky Vengeance and bassist Johnny Christ.\n\nAvenged Sevenfold emerged with a metalcore sound on their debut Sounding the Seventh Trumpet, which included screaming vocals and heavy guitar riffs. The band changed their style on their third release, City of Evil, which features more of a mainstream hard rock style. The band continued to explore new sounds with their self titled release and enjoyed continued mainstream success before their drummer, James Sullivan, &quot;The Rev&quot; died of a drug overdose in 2009. Despite this setback, the band continued on with Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy and released their fifth album Nightmare in 2010.\n\nAvenged Sevenfold has released five studio albums, one live album/compilation, and fifteen singles. The band themselves have received much credit for their worldwide mainstream success and were most notably proclaimed as one of the leaders and key bands in the New Wave of American Heavy Metal and were featured as second place on Ultimate Guitar's Top Ten Bands of the Decade.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f21641a8376cf26a007b0419a2646e7f724b4da4","amp;dn":"Avenged+Sevenfold+-+Unholy+Confessions+%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f21641a8376cf26a007b0419a2646e7f724b4da4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,22,65,168,55,108,242,106,0,123,4,25,162,100,110,127,114,75,77,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
