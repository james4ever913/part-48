What he finds instead is that the ruling elite of the world are aliens in disguise, their aim being to keep humans in a state of mindless consumerism. His discovery comes when he dons a pair of special sunglasses made by a resistance group and sees for the first time reality unadorned. Billboards, store signs, magazine covers--all bear subliminal messages to OBEY, to CONSUME, to have NO INDEPENDENT THOUGHT. Money itself says THIS IS YOUR GOD. But worst of all, with these glasses you see which of us are really hideous, bug-eyed aliens. The conceptual breakthrough is hilarious while keeping its roots in darker matters. Although some fault the film for settling into its action plot, the ending has a great payoff. And the direction by John Carpenter is handled with superb workmanlike aplomb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:716ac6253c30e8e08a72189a98929331ba58c3c6","amp;dn":"John+Carpenter%5C%27s+They+Live","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"716ac6253c30e8e08a72189a98929331ba58c3c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,106,198,37,60,48,232,224,138,114,24,154,152,146,147,49,186,88,195,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
