You'll find deep explanations with more examples and suggestions than in previous and other guides, all in the no-nonsense and understandable writing style for which Thom Hogan has become famous. No matter how well you think you know the D90, you'll find things in this work that you didn't know about the camera (try pressing the OK button twice while reviewing an image; surprised?). That's why it's called a &quot;complete guide.&quot; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec7198f537db3cbe083a365b6a767c631156de91","amp;dn":"D90GUIDE100.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec7198f537db3cbe083a365b6a767c631156de91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,113,152,245,55,219,60,190,8,58,54,91,106,118,124,99,17,86,222,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
