Even if you\\&amp;#039;ve never coded before, just follow the in-depth tutorials and you\\&amp;#039;ll be generating results in minutes! Harness the power of Direct X and make 3D objects come to life in just a few simple commands.\n\n\n\nWhat Makes DarkBASIC So Special?\n\nFor the first time ever, the power of the PC and Microsoft\\&amp;#039;s game engine Direct X can now be controlled by everyday PC users. It\\&amp;#039;s no longer the sole domain of the expert \\&amp;#039;C\\&amp;#039; programmer. Anyone with a PC can now make 3D objects move around the screen interacting with other game objects and taking live responses from the game player\\&amp;#039;s inputs.\n \n\n\nWHY CLASSIC WHEN PRO IS AVAILABLE?\n\n1. Because you can find that 80% of online resources &amp; tutorials available are made for DarkBASIC Classic. There\\&amp;#039;s not Much (FREE) help &amp; resource available for the PRO version.\n2. There are differences in commands of both languages. So if you find a good source and try to run it on DBPro you\\&amp;#039;ll get an error if the commands are not supported.\n\nSO IT SHOULD BE THE BEST CHOICE FOR BEGINNER GAME PROGRAMMER","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85d90077bf2bc374faed1f1d8d7924d82560691e","amp;dn":"DarkBASIC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85d90077bf2bc374faed1f1d8d7924d82560691e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,217,0,119,191,43,195,116,250,237,31,29,141,121,36,216,37,96,105,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
