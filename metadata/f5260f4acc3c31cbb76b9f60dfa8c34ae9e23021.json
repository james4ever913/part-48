What The Fuck is a Hedgehog? Well we done some\nlame research here some definations:\n\n\n\n1. &quot;The Hedgehog was an anti-submarine weapon developed by the Royal Navy \nduring World War II, that was deployed on convoy escort warships such as \ndestroyers to supplement the depth charge. The weapon worked by firing a \nnumber of small spigot mortar bombs from spiked fittings.&quot;\n\n\n\n2. &quot;A hedgehog is any of the small spiny mammals of the subfamily \nErinaceinae and the order Erinaceomorpha. There are 16 species of \nhedgehog in five genera, found through parts of Europe, Asia, \nAfrica, and New Zealand.&quot;\n\n\n3. &quot;Hedgehog is a Melt-Banana 7&quot; EP released in 1994 on Charnel Music.&quot;\n\n\n4. &quot;The Hedgehog proteins are a class of secreted cell?cell signalling \nmolecule. The name derives from the appearance of embryonic Drosophila \nmelanogaster mutants that lack hedgehog gene function. There are many \nvertebrate genes that encode Hedgehog homologues.&quot;\n\n\n\nRL: PAL\n\nlatahhh\n\ntha crew!\n\nPS.
