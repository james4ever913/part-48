Unfortunately for Dick, his teammates are killed by a grenade shortly after they attempt to eliminate a patrol. Disregarding calls from his commanding officers to abort the mission and escape the country, Dick forges ahead, blasting a path through North Korea and Russia as he tries to destroy the missiles before they can be used against the West. The plot is rather poorly developed, as Dick ignores orders, and makes his own decisions on how to kill as many communists as possible over the eight missions of the game.\n:\n:\n:...&gt; Features\n:\nOffline Players: 1\nOnline Multiplayer: 1-16\nOnline Leaderboards\nOnline Voice Support\nEDTV 480p Support\nHDTV 720p Support\nHDTV 1080i Support\nWidescreen 16:9\nDolby 5.1 In-Game \n:\n:\n:...&gt; System Requirements\n:\n*  CPU: Intel Pentium IV at 3.2 Ghz or better\n*  GPU: 56 MB ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ DirectX 9.0c Compatible video card (Nvidia 7900GT or better / ATI Radeon X1800 or better)\n*  OS:  Microsoft Windows XP / Vista / 7 \n*  RAM: 1 GB for Windows XP / 2 GB for Windows Vista / 7\n*  HDD: 6GB\n:\n::\n:::...&gt; how to install\n:\n1...: Double click Setup.exe, wait then\n      press 'c' to choose an installation location (make sure there are no spaces\n      in the installation location),\n      or press 'i' to default install to 'System driveGames.\n      \n      *Note - The setup will create then delete all files needed for installation.
