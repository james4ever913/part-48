He later escaped. Who was he. Why has he not been identified? No one knows. There have been news stories about the Mossad connection in Mumbai ignored by the US press. This news story in the Jerusalme Post was points to an essential item in the conspiracy theories that abound the Indian press and blogs. One Isreali writer says that connection will be covered up quickly.\n\n    Jerusalem Post. Dec 3, 2008 0:44 | Updated Dec 3, 2008 1:24. Mumbai doctor finds no signs of torture on Chabad House bodies\n\n    Millions saw a white shirt, perhaps a tallis, waved in a window, hours before the Indian commandos ended their 12-hour assault in this small building, and apparently found all hostages killed. Any professional has to wonder how many of the hostages died at the hands of the brutal terrorists, and if any were mistakenly killed by some of the shooting from outside (we all saw some Indian policemen firing randomly into the building), as happened at Entebee. This will all be covered up. I do hope the Indian public demands a more rapid and more professional response in future acts of terror. Sam - (12/03/2008 22:54)\n\nThe security officer at the Israeli consulate in Mumbai was arrested by Indian police as he raced toward the Chabad House last Wednesday after Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg telephoned to say it was under attack.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem on Sunday confirmed that the officer had been intercepted en route to what he had hoped would be a rescue mission, but stressed that Israel had no complaints with Indian security personnel over the incident.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAn armed foreigner was running toward them at a terrorist scene,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ said a ministry official. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOf course they arrested him. What would you expect them to do?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nIndeed, The Jerusalem Post has been told that an individual jumped out of a window at the Chabad House early in the unfolding terror attack and ran toward the security guard, and he, too, was arrested by Indian police.\n\nThe Israeli consulate is located just a few streets away from the Chabad House.\n\nThe last known word from Chabad emissary Holtzberg, who was found dead in the building 60 hours later along with his wife Rivka and other victims, came in the phone call to the consulate in which he reported the attack.\n\nThe call was cut off in mid-conversation.\n\nThe security officer immediately raced to the Chabad House to try to help, but was stopped close to the building.\n\nHe was not carrying identification papers, the Post was told - perhaps, it is speculated, in case he himself fell into the hands of the terrorists. However, one Indian security official recognized him, the Post was told.\n\nThe security officer was released from jail a few hours after he was detained.
