In fact, Roe's initial pop smash, 1962's chart-topping &quot;Sheila,&quot; was quite reminiscent of Holly's &quot;Peggy Sue,&quot; utilizing a very similar throbbing drumbeat and Roe's hiccuping vocal. The singer had previously cut the song for the smaller Judd label before remaking it in superior form for ABC-Paramount. The infectious &quot;Everybody&quot; -- another hot item the next year -- was waxed in Muscle Shoals at Rick Hall's Fame studios, normally an R&amp;B-oriented facility (it's not widely known that Roe wrote songs for the Tams, a raw-edged soul group from his Atlanta hometown). Once Roe veered off on his squeaky-clean bubblegum tangent, he stuck with it for the rest of the decade. His lighthearted &quot;Sweet Pea&quot; and &quot;Hooray for Hazel&quot; burned up the charts in 1966, and he was still at it three years later when he waxed his biggest hit, &quot;Dizzy,&quot; and &quot;Jam Up Jelly Tight.&quot;\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/tommy-roe-p5296/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/tommy-roe-p5296/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/r229651&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/r229651&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000092L02&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000092L02&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
