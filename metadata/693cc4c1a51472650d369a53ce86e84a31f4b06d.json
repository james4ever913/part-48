She briefly came back for some ranting and cursing and that was it! Scandal!\n\n- After &quot;Asking For It&quot; Courtney erupts into a long rant at a goth girl in the audience throwing out comments like how she and Kurt hated Amsterdam...and then that was the sudden end to the show...\n\n- After just six songs, Courtney Love decided to stop playing and waded out into audience attacking fans in an attempt to find the girl who had allegedly been throwing a glass of water and shouting:\n\n&quot;You Killed Kurt!&quot;\n\n\n1995\nReuters: A &quot;Hole&quot; Of A Concert\nMelody Maker: &quot;Courtney Clouts Crowd&quot;\nUSA Today: &quot;Hole Concert Ends On Stormy Note&quot;\n+\n2005\nDIME's own newtdecay aka Rebecca: &quot;Great Hissy Fit&quot;\n+\ntoday \nthewaymouth aka mikedreams on...\n\n[see &quot;i like stories&quot; text incl]\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n- What I wrote to Jenny after listening to Hole, 1995-04-26, London, UK, Virgin Megastore [oh, he will be loosing out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored... If you request it, you get it, see how it works. I am the TJ, I am what I say I am be damned]\n\n&quot;Drown Soda.&quot;...Blazing.\n\nOn the 1994-1995 tour she sings like no one I have ever heard before I since. So direct. Kurt was intense like that. But he never gave as much of himself away as this. But then no one has. I am sure they have but screaming while still in tune? She sings like her life depends on it. She is putting on a show but it's real. I don't know. It's a feeling I get, that I have.\n\nI guess the interest isn't there but there should be full shows from that era available to the public. Hell, at least one.\n\nNot that the RnR Hall Of Fame means shit really, but Courtney belongs in it for this tour alone. \n\n\n- Fuck yeah she can play, too. And Eric Erlandsen always sticks the lands end.\n\n\n- And uh-oh here he goes again: I am sure others have carried that weight, brought a ton of recent baggage onstage with them, but as heavy as this? And still been able to deliver? But then she was that much more intense because \nshe was dragging him around with her. His ghost brought the most out of her. Except she was the one to bring it on.\n\nOf course, we were part of it all, too. The atmosphere was so heavy and electric when I saw her, like nothing I have felt before or since. \n\nIt was summer, outdoors at night, and I was on mushrooms not fumes. \n\nWe were all still reeling... \n\n\n1994 happens to be the low-point of my life. Let's just say I was left for dead but buried deeply alive by my partner in crime, the rolling rock of the rest of my life over. If April be the cruelest month, pile on. \n\nSo in that same month, it was a prelude actually, when Kurt checked out like he did, it hit me hard and ever harder. I did not know if I would make it through the year somehow. But she did, so...\n\nThen I saw her standing there in 1995. \n\nWith one foot firmly planted on the monitor at the edge of the stage and the world, leaning back and then in and always on and with us and off into the night.\n\nI hear her from back then right now. \n\nIt's still like now it's still like, after that what else is there? But time in between her taking more of the full breadth of my breath away.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\n\n2014-11-07 @ The Pirate Bay around thewaymouth aka mikedreams on...high on Courtney\n\n\n- One show stopped short, the other incomplete. But both totally all in, thrillin, killin.\n\n\n- Paradiso: Just Do It aka Black Day aka Time To Kill aka No, No, No\n\n...Unrelenting unreleased unleashed.\n\nThis is all worth it for that alone.\n\n\n- The Palace: The end of Violet rips my heartstrings.\n\n\n- Hole on the 1994-1995 Live This Through Tour... \n\nMourning has broken wounds and wings flying everywhere at once wide open.\n\nThe most insanely intensely amazing tour ever.\n\nI am sure you have your choice voice. \n\nI am just forever lucky and still touched by the hole in my head and heart by being personally affected up close and in awesome. \n\nI saw her standing there alive in 1995 in the Great Woods Holeapalooza, the Greatest Heart Of Show Time...\n\nHear her soar now.\n\u001f\n__________________\n\n\nHeArt samples...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k256/thewaymouth/Hole/R-994025-1303944672.jpeg~original&quot;
