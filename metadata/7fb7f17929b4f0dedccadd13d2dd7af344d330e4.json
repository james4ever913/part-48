They are immediately sent deep into the heart of the conflict: Kandahar Province, where the Taliban insurgency is fiercest. Afghanada gives us a gruntsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢-eye-view of the conflict. Every day, these Canadian soldiers on the ground confront the chaos and violence of life &quot;outside the wire&quot;. They donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have the big picture; theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re not interested in the policy. TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re just trying to help the people, protect each other...and survive.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fb7f17929b4f0dedccadd13d2dd7af344d330e4","amp;dn":"Afghanada+%5B2007%5D+-+Afghanada+Vol.+02","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fb7f17929b4f0dedccadd13d2dd7af344d330e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,183,241,121,41,180,240,222,220,202,221,19,210,221,122,243,68,211,48,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
