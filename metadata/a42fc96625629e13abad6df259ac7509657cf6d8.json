Don't get me wrong I love Mail, but this one does a lot more that Mail, but one feature that I didn't like was the ability to add stationary - try it out and see if you like it...\n\nOfficial Web Site: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.postbox-inc.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.postbox-inc.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPostbox 2 is first class email software that puts you in the driverÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s seat. Stay on task, find information quickly and act, not react.\n\n* Account Groups\n\nPostbox 2 now supports Unified Inboxes, which lets you combine messages from multiple accounts into one Inbox.\n\nAccounts can also be organized into Account Groups, so you can keep your work and personal messages separate.\n\nAdd as many accounts to a group as desired. Then, select a group to get a unified view for messages within the group.\n\n* Focus Pane\n\nPostbox 2 introduces the Focus Pane, a new feature that lets you break your Inbox (and workload) into smaller, more manageable chunks.\n\nEasily organize the Focus Pane by your highest work priorities ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ such as projects, clients or events ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ then focus on these messages without losing track of what's happening elsewhere.\n\n* Summarized Replies\n\nPostboxÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Conversation View simplifies message viewing, and now, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSummarize ModeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ extends these benefits to message Replies and Forwards.\n\nSummarize provides a clean and beautifully formatted who-said-what-when email that lets message recipients jump into discussions with more clarity, context and insight.\n\n* Quick Reply\n\nQuick Reply lets you reply to a message without the need to open a separate compose window, which is perfect for short, snappy responses such as &quot;I'll see you at eight,&quot; or simply &quot;thanks!&quot;\n\nAnd it all happens inline within a message or conversation, so that you can get right back to what you were doing.\n\nSystem Requirements:\n\nMac OS X 10.5 and Snow Leopard\nIntel Core processor family\n\nLink to the manual: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.postbox-inc.com/quickstart&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.postbox-inc.com/quickstart&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-- PLEASE SEED --\n\nI'm looking for BusyCal from the same co., iConCalPro but haven't found it yet....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a42fc96625629e13abad6df259ac7509657cf6d8","amp;dn":"PostBox+v2.1.3+%2B+sn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a42fc96625629e13abad6df259ac7509657cf6d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,47,201,102,37,98,158,19,171,173,109,242,89,172,117,9,101,124,246,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
