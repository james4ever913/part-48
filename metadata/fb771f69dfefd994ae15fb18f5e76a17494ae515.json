Carlisle gained worldwide fame as the lead vocalist of The Go-Go's, who made history as the first all-female music group to write their own songs and play their own instruments to top the Billboard charts. The Go-Go's are considered by some to be the most successful all-female band of all time. As part of the Go-Go's, Carlisle sold more than seven million albums, and later went on to a successful solo career that spawned hits such as &quot;Mad About You,&quot; &quot;Summer Rain,&quot; &quot;I Get Weak,&quot; &quot;Leave a Light On&quot; and &quot;Heaven Is a Place on Earth&quot;, which topped the charts internationally, including in the United States and United Kingdom. Her autobiography, Lips Unsealed, released in June 2010, reached #27 on the New York Times Bestseller List and received favorable reviews.\n\nBackground information\nOrigin.: ollywood, Los Angeles, California\nGenres.: Pop rock\nYears active.: 1978ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“present\nLabels.: I.R.S.
