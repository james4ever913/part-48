It is made in Visual Basic 6.0, and is an almost replica of SwiftSwitch, except for the fact that i&amp;#039;ve added Cheating Utilities and Functions to make it more suitable for my needs. I originally started making this program because i was sic of having to see Ads in F2p Worlds and waiting for a world to be empty before i could get into it, since then it&amp;#039;s turn into a fairly big project with over 50 regular users daily. I suggest that if you use SwiftSwitch that you try EliteSwitch and i guarentee that you will instantly be hooked to this Client and Uninstall SwiftSwitch immediately. EliteSwitch is updated regularly to fix problems that jagex make when adding new worlds and site pages etc. EliteSwitch&amp;#039;s Auto&amp;#039;s like the Auto Buyer and Auto Tele&amp;#039;r are under a total makeover .\n\n&gt; Account Creator\n    - Create your new RuneScape Account in Seconds.\n\n&gt; Advanced World Switching Methods\n    - Connects to a World even if it&amp;#039;s Full.\n    - Displays ALL Information on your Current World.\n    - Connect to Worlds on High or Low Detail.\n    - Connect to Worlds on Any Java Type.\n    - Least and Most Full Worlds Functions.\n    - Hover Over a World to Find how many Players are in it.\n    - Ability to Set a &amp;#039;Home&amp;#039; World.\n    - Ability to Mute the RuneScape Loading Music.\n    - Ability to see all the Worlds you have Visited.\n    - Ability to Hide the Ad&amp;#039;s on Free Worlds.\n\n&gt; Auto Clicker\n\n&gt; Auto Login\n    - Works on All Screen Resolutions.\n\n&gt; Auto Talker\n\n&gt; Auto Updater\n\n&gt; Bug Reporting System\n\n&gt; Calculators\n    - Full Skills Calculator.\n    - Merchanters Calculator.\n    - Max Hit Calculator.\n    - Combat Calculator.\n    - Fighting Calculator.\n    - Progress Calculator.\n    - Pest Control Calculator.\n\n&gt; Compare Highscores\n\n&gt; Credits Section\n\n&gt; Custom Linking\n\n&gt; Dual Login\n    - Uses the Deletion of UID.dat, less lag then standard Dual Login Techniques.\n\n&gt; IRC Chat\n    - Handles every Command for the Average User.\n    - Connects to Any Server you wish.\n\n&gt; Item Pricer\n\n&gt; Minizing Function\n    - Minimizes EliteSwitch to the System Tray.\n\n&gt; Multi Screenshotting\n    - Full Screen Screenshots.\n    - RuneScape Applet Only Screenshots.\n    - Drag Screenshots.\n    - Ability to View your Screenshots.\n    - Screenshot Uploader.\n\n&gt; Quick Launch Utilities\n    - MSN Messenger.\n    - Command Prompt.\n    - System Calculator.\n    - Microsoft Paint.\n    - Microsoft Notepad.\n\n&gt; Quick Links\n    - All RuneScape Pages.\n    - Skills Guide.\n    - Quests Guide.\n    - Cities Guide.\n    - Pricing Guide.\n    - Treasure Trail Guide.\n    - RuneScape Cheating Links.\n    - RuneScape Help Links.\n    - Image Uploading Links.\n    - File Uploading Links.\n    - Items Database.\n    - Monster Database.\n    - NPC Database.\n\n&gt; Server Status\n    - Displays how many Players in each World.\n    - Displays if a World is Offline.\n    - Highlights Worlds that are Least and Most Full.\n    - Can load a world from the Server Status Page.\n\n&gt; Settings System\n    - Saves All your current EliteSwitch Settings upon Exit.\n\n&gt; Skinning System\n    - Select a Different Background Theme.\n    - Select a Different Button Style.\n    - You can even Design your Own Custom Theme.\n\n&gt; Statistics Lookup\n    - Quick and Easy Stats Lookup.\n    - Hover Over the Usernames Skill Level to see their Experience and Ranking.\n\n&gt; Suggestions System\n\n&gt; Treasure Trail Help\n    - Extensive Treasure Trail Guides.\n    - Treasure Trail Co-Ordinate Locator.\n    - Treasure Trail Puzzle Solutions.\n\n&gt; Web Browser\n    - Opens All links within EliteSwitch&amp;#039;s Own Web Based Browser.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47f5639e7ff6f6adfdaa652483edd56b0f7ed81e","amp;dn":"EliteSwitch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47f5639e7ff6f6adfdaa652483edd56b0f7ed81e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,245,99,158,127,246,246,173,253,170,101,36,131,237,213,107,15,126,216,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
