Poitier also directed. This was the second film pairing of Poitier and Cosby following Uptown Saturday Night. Cosby and Poitier teamed up again for A Piece of the Action in 1977. Although their characters have different names in each film, the three Poitier-Cosby pictures are considered to be a trilogy. Of the three, Let's Do It Again has been the most successful both critically and commercially. Calvin Lockhart and Lee Chamberlin also appeared in Uptown Saturday Night as different characters. The song of the same name by The Staple Singers was featured as the opening and ending theme of the movie, and as a result, the two have become commonly associated with each other.\n\nSet in Atlanta, it follows Clyde Williams (Poitier) and Billy Foster (Cosby) as a pair of blue-collar workers who are trying to raise funds for the Brothers and Sisters of Shaka. They decide to rig a boxing match in New Orleans. They use hypnotism to convince Bootney Farnsworth (Jimmie Walker) that he is a highly skilled prize fighter. He fights and wins, and Williams and Foster cleanup after betting on him, the underdog. They return home, and all is fine until the gangsters who lost money betting on the other guy figure out the scam and come to Atlanta, to get the pair to do it again...or be killed.\n\nUnable to enter Farnsworth's training room to hypnotize him again, Williams and Foster decide to bet on the match being a draw, and place bets with both gangster groups. They then enter his opponent's training room and successfully hypnotize him. Both fighters end up simultaneously knocking each other out, and Williams and Foster are able to collect their bets before the gangsters discover what happened.\n\n    * Sidney Poitier ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Clyde Williams\n    * Bill Cosby ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Billy Foster\n    * Calvin Lockhart ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Biggie Smalls\n    * John Amos ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Kansas City Mack\n    * Jimmie Walker ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Bootney Farnsworth\n    * Ossie Davis ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Elder Johnson\n    * Denise Nicholas ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Beth Foster\n    * Lee Chamberlin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Dee Dee Williams\n    * Mel Stewart ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ellison\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58dd4a20d693a1b59dd0914cc79e51a8f159651a","amp;dn":"Let%5C%27s+Do+It+Again+-+FULL+DVD+-+1975","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58dd4a20d693a1b59dd0914cc79e51a8f159651a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,221,74,32,214,147,161,181,157,208,145,76,199,158,81,168,241,89,101,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
