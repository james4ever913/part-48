More than just a scientific exploration, &quot;Imagining the Tenth Dimension&quot; is a mind-expanding exercise that could change the way you view this incredible universe in which we live.\n\nChapters:\n\n\n01 A Quick Tour of Ten Dimensions\n\nIn this chapter, we explore much more fully the information presented on this site: a way that the ten dimensions can be imagined, with each stacked one upon another.\n\n\n02 The Quantum Observer\n\nThis concept comes from quantum physics, which tells us that subatomic particles are actually waves of probability. It is the act of observation that collapses these waves into one particular state. According to the structure weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re exploring here, how does the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œquantum observerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ fit into the picture?\n\n\n03 The Flow of Time\n\nWhile EinsteinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s theories treated space and time as an entity, the more common approach in string theory and physics has been to treat time as an aspect which is separate from the other spatial dimensions. In this chapter we argue that time is indeed the fourth spatial dimension, and it is only our unique viewpoint as quantum observers that gives us the illusion of time being a one-way ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œarrowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\n\n04 The Binary Viewpoint\n\nWhat happens when you divide any point in the universe into ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhere are the things it isÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhere are the things that it isnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½? ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the binary viewpoint of reality. Popularized in the film ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe MatrixÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and in Star TrekÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œholodeckÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, the idea of a world that could be indistinguishable from reality if we only we had a fast enough computer with a large enough memory has interesting connections to the way we are imagining our ten dimensions. In this chapter we explore how this reductive analysis of the universe might be applied to the ten dimensions weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re imagining.\n\n\n05 Memes, Music and Memory\n\nOne of the contradictions that seem to be inherent in the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œquantum observer collapsing realityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ argument is that there would be no subatomic particles without an observer. EverettÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMany Worlds TheoryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is now becoming more popularly accepted by string theorists as one explanation of this apparent contradiction. His theory explains that an observer is not necessary because all possible states do actually exist simultaneously, and the act of observation is not ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcollapsingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a particle, it is merely ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œobservingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a part of a wave in one of its simultaneously existing states. Still, whether we are ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œobservingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcollapsingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, the end result is the same. But does the quantum observer have to be a person? In this chapter we explore the many other ways that a quantum observer could be present, including some of the more metaphysical aspects of this discussion.\n\n\n06 The Anthropic Viewpoint\n\nThere are usually two versions of the Anthropic Viewpoint. The first says that the reason we live in such an unlikely universe, created from countless lucky coincidences that led to the complex world we see around us, is that if those lucky coincidences hadnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t occurred we would not be here to ask the question of why we are here. However, the version of the Anthropic Viewpoint that is more relevant to our discussion says that all the other less fortunate universes do really exist, weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re just not in them. Some criticize the anthropic viewpoint as being a dead end or a cop out. But, as we explore in this chapter, this second version of the Anthropic Viewpoint is currently popular under a different guise in modern physics, and fits in well with our version of the ten dimensions.\n\n\n07 The Paradoxes of Time Travel\n\nIt keeps coming back to this: the difference between the worldview presented here and the view of science in general stems from the proposition that time is a full spatial dimension. If time really is a spatial dimension, then free motion within it should some day be possible, and in chapter 3 we explored some of the ways that scientists have proposed that time travel could occur. But there are also many famous stories and films that imagine what it would be like if we could travel in time. In this chapter we look at this subject as it has been presented by works of fiction, and explore how these viewpoints fit (or donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t fit) with the ten dimensions we are now imagining.\n\n\n08 Dark Matter and Other Mysteries\n\nDark Matter and Dark Energy are two of the biggest quandaries currently facing modern science. In this chapter we look at our new concept of the ten dimensions and explore whether any of the current unsolved mysteries of physics could some day be found to have their answers hidden within this new way of viewing the world. We also explore some of the more paranormal mysteries which might have an explanation from this viewpoint. As a mind-expanding exercise, we also explore some of the other ways that reality could be connected together that we are not currently conscious of, plus the hidden processing that the brain could well be executing to participate in the reality we are imagining here.\n\n\n09 How Much Control Do We Have?\n\nWe have now imagined a reality where everything is possible. Everything that could have happened, did. Everything that is about to possibly happen, does. Even the things that we know didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t happen or couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t happen on our own timeline, did happen elsewhere in another part of the dimensional construct weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re imagining. But if thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all there is, then what is the point? As creatures with free will, should we care what weÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re about to do if there are other universes where we did the opposite? And if everyone around us is capable of every possible good and bad thing imaginable, how do we ever get anywhere? This chapter attempts to put these questions into perspective.\n\n\n10 Triads: The Ten Dimensions Revisited\n\nThis chapter provides us with some different ways of thinking about the ten dimensions that may be useful to those who are still having difficulty with the concepts presented. Rather than just being a re-statement of chapter one, we look at some new ideas which might have been too big to assimilate without first having worked our way through the other chapters.\n\n\n11 Interference and Connections\n\nIn the final chapter, we add another wrinkle to our construct which helps us to imagine the mysterious nature of life, and the forces from the higher dimensions that could be helping us all to move in certain directions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad6580ef3463628d1db14ed66ccd2470f66c2a72","amp;dn":"Imagining+the+Tenth+Dimension","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad6580ef3463628d1db14ed66ccd2470f66c2a72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,101,128,239,52,99,98,141,29,177,78,214,108,205,36,112,246,108,42,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
