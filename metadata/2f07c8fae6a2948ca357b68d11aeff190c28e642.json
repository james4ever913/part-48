Jackson) shows no mercy and tries his best to force Younger (Sheen) to reveal the 'three' secret locations of the nuclear bombs along with Special Agent Helen B. from the FBI who strongly disapprove with his methods. At the beginning of the interrogation, 'H' shows everyone that he is the 'real deal' when he straps Younger's arm onto a table and chops off one of his fingers with a small hatchet. Surprised by this, Special Agent Helen B. questions the commander about the rights of an American citizen and the Geneva convention but is told afterwards that anything could be done and would be done to get the locations of the nuclear bombs. As the story progresses, 'H' warns everyone that he would do the unthinkable if necessary and does them as Younger does not co-operate. He brings in his wife and after failing to make Younger co-operate again, despite Younger's condition after days of torture, he slashes Younger's wife at the throat and she bleeds to death. Extremely frustrated and furious, Younger rages and shows signs of being mentally sick but does still does not reveal the locations of the bombs. 'H', deciding to take this one step further, and the furthest that he had ever gone\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0914863/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0914863/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNOTE-&gt;This does not jump at the end of the movie as other one did just thought i would mention this before someone asked thanks enjoy...VICE\n\nPLEASE SEED AND ENJOY THANKS\n\nscreen shots\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img94.imageshack.us/img94/723/unthinkablexvidviceavit.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img94.imageshack.us/img94/723/unthinkablexvidviceavit.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f07c8fae6a2948ca357b68d11aeff190c28e642","amp;dn":"Unthinkable.2010.DvDRip.XviD..vice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f07c8fae6a2948ca357b68d11aeff190c28e642","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,7,200,250,230,162,148,140,163,87,182,141,17,174,255,25,12,40,230,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
