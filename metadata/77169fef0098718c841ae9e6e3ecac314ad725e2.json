Formed in 1983, they are considered pioneers in the mainstream popularization of Christian rock/metal music. They have done what few other Christian bands have done; selling millions of albums to secular people and becoming one of MTV&amp;#039;s most requested bands in the 80&amp;#039;s. Stryper enjoyed great success during the late 80&amp;#039;s before breaking up in 1992, when most 80&amp;#039;s metal groups lost popularity. However, the band reunited in 2003.\n\nThe name &quot;Stryper&quot; derives from the King James Version of Isaiah 53:5:\n&quot;But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.&quot;(1)\nThe scriptural reference is also part of Stryper&amp;#039;s logo on most of their releases. In addition, the band&amp;#039;s name has been said to stand for:\n\n&quot;Salvation Through Redemption, Yielding Peace,\nEncouragement, and Righteousness.&quot;\n\n1. Sing Along Song\n2.
