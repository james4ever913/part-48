The song was Cope's only chart-topping single on any U.S. chart, reaching #1 on the then-new Modern Rock Tracks chart in the United States for one week in early 1989.\n\nJulian Cope (born Julian David Cope, on 21 October 1957) is a British rock musician, author, antiquary, musicologist, and poet who came to prominence in 1978 as the singer and songwriter in Liverpool post-punk band The Teardrop Explodes. Cope has since released many solo albums and is a founding member of the bands Queen Elizabeth and Brain Donor. In addition to his musical career, Cope has written four books of non-fiction: Krautrocksampler (Head Heritage, 1995), The Modern Antiquarian (Thorsons, 1998), The Megalithic European (Element, 2004), and Japrocksampler (Bloomsbury, 2007), plus two volumes of autobiography: Head-On (Head Heritage, 1994) and Repossessed (HarperCollins, 1999).\n\nMy Nation Underground was the fourth solo album by Julian Cope. It is historically disliked by the artist as an attempt to force a commercial sound of his recordings. Critical views generally support this view. My Nation Underground contains three singles, including &quot;Charlotte Anne&quot;, which got to number 35 in the UK charts in September 1988.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b4cf096a2055030bc886d83e7c41abcb38dfb13","amp;dn":"Julian+Cope+-+Charlotte+Anne","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b4cf096a2055030bc886d83e7c41abcb38dfb13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,76,240,150,162,5,80,48,188,136,109,131,231,196,26,188,179,141,251,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
