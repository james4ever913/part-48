One day later a \\'Hotfix\\' became available to fix a bug which didn\\'t allow players to continue on their saved game if they were running a Polish League after they had installed the v11.2.0 patch. v11.2.1 is the latest version of the game. v11.3.0 has now been released as of 8 March and includes all World Transfers from the January transfer window, as well as various game fixes.[14]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62e1e4a66058a589f2d77370ee891e87393b4e0f","amp;dn":"Football+Manager+2011+Patch+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62e1e4a66058a589f2d77370ee891e87393b4e0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,225,228,166,96,88,165,137,242,215,115,112,238,137,30,135,57,59,78,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
