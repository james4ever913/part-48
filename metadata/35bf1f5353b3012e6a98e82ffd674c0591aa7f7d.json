The new scene rules sucks big time. Look at our last nukes.      |\n\n|  Radio Express isn't a valid store anymore. It's true, Radio Express       |\n\n|  isn't a normal shop, it's a radio service, delivering promo's. You got    |\n\n|  to have a licence to have access, work for radio or be a registered       |\n\n|  prof. DJ. What happened to the scene lately   The scene used to be the    |\n\n|  place to find all the latest promo's before they were in the stores.      |\n\n|  Isn't that allowed anymore   We are now in  2011, record companies won't  |\n\n|  deliver promo cds anymore, it's all downloaded. And Radio Express is one  |\n\n|  of those places. So how can we tag this rls   As a -PROMO_WEB-   That     |\n\n|  option seems to be forgotten in the latest rules. We were never asked to  |\n\n|  discuss about those new scene rules, and we didn't sign them either       |\n\n|  (never asked). So we are left with one option, to release all our Radio   |\n\n|  Express and Radio Ventures stuff as an -INT-. We are not happy about      |\n\n|  this, makes us sad and frustrated, we used to do this for fun. But        |\n\n|  were's the fun lately                                                     |\n\n|  A question we asked ourself: What about all those Promo Only CDs,         |\n\n|  MmsCanada, X-Mix, and so on... These are no ordinary webshops 2, same     |\n\n|  thing. Nuke them 2 now    Have fun nukeboys, you are slowly killing the   |\n\n|  scene.
