Alex also dissects the flopping failure that is Obamacare and marvels at its miserable enrollment figures, which the healthcare law is supposedly dependent upon. \n\nOn today's show, Jones tackles the increasingly volatile situation in Crimea, and analyzes the US government's latest attempt to suppress the First Amendment by way of a new media shield law, which antithetically doesn't &quot;shield&quot; alternative media journalists like activist Mark Dice, a vocal opponent of the Obama administration, who recently had his immensely popular Youtube channel taken down.
