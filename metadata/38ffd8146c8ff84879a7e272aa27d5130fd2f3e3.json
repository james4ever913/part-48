By Paul Beelen, February 2006.\n\nThis 20 page whitepaper explores the influence of technology in advertising, marketing and media, and the threats and opportunities triggered by the revolution of the new, social internet.\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThere has never been so much change in the way people communicate than there is right now. New generations use tools their parents don?t even understand, and young people consume news as easy as they create and publish it themselves. These shifts in communication will undoubtedly have consequences for the communication industry. Can advertising campaigns still be based on a mix between 30 second tv commercials, print ads in top-down media and below the line activities?\n\nRoughly five years after the burst of the Internet bubble, developers and investors are regaining trust in the World Wide Web. But not in the web as we know it. This time it?s about conversation, cooperation, and empowerment of the masses. This time it is bottom-up, instead of top-down. People are taking back the web that companies have been trying to commercialize for the past 10 years, without much success. This time, the web is going social. Within the Internet community, this new, grown up version of the web is called Web 2.0.\n\nIf we combine the social aspects of new web applications (which I will explain later on) with technological developments such as the ever dropping price of hardware, the rise of wireless communications and the massification of mobile phones, we can start to see mayor changes in a lot of aspects today?s advertising relies on to be effective. This paper intends to explore these changes.\n\nWhat?s the effect of an advertising campaign, in a world where every consumer has instant access to all hard data about any given product? How can we even reach these consumers in a media landscape that consists of millions of personal blogs, podcasts and time shifted television?\n\nWhat is the role of marketing when consumers are directly connected to almost anybody within the companies they buy from? In this paper I will attempt to provide some answers (or at least clues), but for now, the best way to be prepared is to simply be aware of the fact that things are changing. Something has been set off, that is impossible to stopped. And it will force advertising to reinvent itself in quite a few ways.\n\nThe Chemistry of Health\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.asiaing.com/images/stories/book/Chemistry.of.Health.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.asiaing.com/images/stories/book/Chemistry.of.Health.gif&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThis science education booklet describes how basic chemistry and biochemistry research can spur a better understanding of human health. The booklet highlights the research of a number of chemists and includes questions at the end of each chapter.\n\nForward:\n\nHow could anybody fit all of chemistry into 66 pages? You&amp;#039;re skeptical that such a feat could possibly be accomplished, and with good reason. The Chemistry of Health cannot pretend to cover such an enormous area of science in so few pages. We wouldn&amp;#039;t even want to try. Instead, this science education booklet aims to offer a sampling of how basic chemistry and biochemistry research can spur a better understanding of human health. We also want you to witness the fascination of research alive in today&amp;#039;s chemistry labs.\n\nChemistry is anything but stale or static. Countless numbers of chemical reactions work ceaselessly inside your body, allowing you to think, breathe, and eat. Chapter 1, &quot;Actions and Reactions,&quot; aims to convey the essential and wondrous notion that the chemistry inside your body never stops. Cascades of repeating biochemical relays keep your organ systems operating smoothly and efficiently. Your body&amp;#039;s metabolic factories break down the food you eat and recycle the components back into basic building blocks from which your tissues and organs are built.\n\nScientists hunger for information since, like many others, they are curious people. But a key reason biological scientists strive to learn how living systems work is so they can redesign the broken metabolic circuits that contribute to many diseases. Chemists, like most biologists, want to learn how best to employ primitive organisms like bacteria and yeast, not only to probe fundamental biological questions but also to produce the valuable commodities we call medicines. Chapter 2, &quot;Harnessing Biology&amp;#039;s Magic,&quot; explores how biotechnology offers rich potential toward bettering human health....","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:38ffd8146c8ff84879a7e272aa27d5130fd2f3e3","amp;dn":"eBooks.%26.Magazines.Pack.September.16.07-LegalTorrents","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"38ffd8146c8ff84879a7e272aa27d5130fd2f3e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,255,216,20,108,143,248,72,121,167,226,114,170,39,213,19,15,210,243,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
