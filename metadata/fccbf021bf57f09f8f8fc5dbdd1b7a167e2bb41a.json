With lush watercolors and his characteristic wit, Evens details the fumbling, amateurish foibles of the participants of a small art festival in the Flemish countryside.\n\nPieterjan is invited to the festival as an honored guest. From the moment he arrives, things start going wrong, and since no one seems ready to step in, Pieterjan takes over the show. He decides to build a giant garden gnome as a symbol of Flemish identity, but the construction process brings buried tensions to the surface as the other artists become jealous of PieterjanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s authority. In The Making Of, Evens delves deep into the petty tensions, small misunderstandings, and deadpan humor that pervade modern relationships.\n\nWith a keen eye for the subtleties of body language, EvensÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Making Of builds on the iconic visual style showcased in The Wrong Place. Sweeping watercolors jump off the page, surrealist scenery intermingles with crowds of people, and small suburban plot homes have never looked so lovely.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fccbf021bf57f09f8f8fc5dbdd1b7a167e2bb41a","amp;dn":"Brecht+Evens+-+The+Making+Of","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fccbf021bf57f09f8f8fc5dbdd1b7a167e2bb41a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,203,240,33,191,87,240,159,143,143,197,219,221,27,122,22,126,43,180,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
