The whole show is in the hands of two or three collectors who so far haven&amp;#039;t shared it.  But, apart from three tracks (Live Wire, Rocker &amp; Let there be Rock) most of the show is available, following a recent Dutch radio broadcast (&quot;Legendarisch Live&quot; on 11 May 2007).  I have sequed in &quot;Live Wire&quot; from the audience-sourced version (quite good except for some variation in the treble and a little flat overall) along with the nine available (and excellent-sounding) soundboard tracks, for the best and most complete version thus far available.\n\nThe DJ&amp;#039;s comments have been removed.\n\n\n\n    01) Live Wire (aud)\n    02) Shot Down in Flames\n    03) Hell Ain&amp;#039;t a Bad Place to Be\n    04) Sin City\n    05) Walk All Over You\n    06) Bad Boy Boogie\n    07) The Jack\n    08) Highway to Hell\n    09) High Voltage\n    10) Whole Lotta Rosie\n    missing last two tracks - Rocker - Let There Be Rock\n\n\nMany thanks to Feelgood for the original torrent!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9daa55ab44b22a16872d88abac536cefbf7d005","amp;dn":"ACDC+-+Live+1979-11-12+Jaap+Edenhal%2C+Amsterdam%2C+The+Netherlands%2C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9daa55ab44b22a16872d88abac536cefbf7d005","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,218,165,90,180,75,34,161,104,114,216,138,186,197,54,206,251,247,208,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
