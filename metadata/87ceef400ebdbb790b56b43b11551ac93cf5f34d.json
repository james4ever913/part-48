His love for video games and anime takes his unique sound and fierce lyrical flow to a new level. At age 9, Image found his love for writing rhymes and poetry expressing his creative side and his ever expanding imagination growing and developing his skills to all types of genres of music from Hip Hop, Rock, Electronica, Jazz, R&amp;B, Punk, Metal, Orchestrated scores, and more. Very influenced by Hip Hop artists, such as Wu-Tang Clan, Eminem, Nas, Biggie, Outkast and Canibus, Image started to take music more seriously.  At age 13 after hearing the release of Wu-TangÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s 1997 single Ã¢â‚¬Å“TriumphÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, the first verse by Inspecta Deck  inspired him so much that he wanted to mimic the very energy and creativeness to express his more dark side and views of the world. With help from his musically gifted cousin's King Beatz and JGAD, Image became a versatile artist making it easy for him to adapt to any beat. After JGAD joined the Muleface crew, with Prince Ferg and AK, Image Dragen then joined the group of talented artists to help expand his horizons and help push a new sound to the music world.\n\nTrack List:\n1. &quot;Mic Choke&quot; ( Intro Verse )\n2. &quot;Kill Beatz&quot; featuring Prince Ferg and StaySwift\n3. &quot;GamerGirl / GameOver&quot; Featuring AK and StaySwift \n4. &quot;The Trip&quot; featuring StaySwift\n5. &quot;Dragen's Back&quot; \n6. &quot;RoundTable&quot; Featuring AK and Prince Ferg\n7. &quot;It's Alright&quot; \n8. &quot;Spit the Game&quot;\n9. &quot;Snap&quot; Featuring D.I.P.\n10. &quot;Catch me on the Block&quot; Onblast featuring Image Dragen\n11. &quot;Bad Wings&quot; featuring D.I.P.\n12. &quot;Fucked Up&quot; featuring D.I.P.\n13. &quot;Blown Away M.N.S.&quot; \n14. &quot;Pour it up Remix&quot; FGM Beats featuring Image Dragen\n15. &quot;Ya'll don't Know&quot; \n16. &quot;Why I do It&quot;\n17. &quot;Tron Song&quot; featuring Prince Ferg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87ceef400ebdbb790b56b43b11551ac93cf5f34d","amp;dn":"Image+Dragen+-+2040+Mixtape","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87ceef400ebdbb790b56b43b11551ac93cf5f34d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,206,239,64,14,189,187,121,11,86,180,59,17,85,26,201,60,245,243,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
