Let's only hope that this is not the last time we see these guys come around, and that future tours and studio recordings are in the works.\n\n\n.:TRACKLIST:.\n\n\n.: Cd 1 :.\n\n\n1 - E5150 - After all (the dead)\n2 - The Mob Rules\n3 - Children of the sea\n4 - Lady Evil\n5 - I\n6 - The sign of the southern cross\n7 - Voodoo\n8 - The Devil Cried \n\n.:RIP LOG:.\n\n[CODE]Exact Audio Copy V1.0 beta 1 from 15.
