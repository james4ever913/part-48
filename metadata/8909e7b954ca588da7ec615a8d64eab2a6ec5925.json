If your XBMC Directory is\n   elsewhere you must change its Application Path by editing the .cfg file !! \n   Rename the &quot;ShortCut for -C-Drive.cfg&quot; and the &quot;ShortCut for -C-Drive.xbe&quot;\n   to something your BIOS can boot (evoxdash.xbe + evoxdash.cfg) + copy both\n   files to the ROOT of your -C-Drive.\n   !! Double check !! you did everything right then reboot - Voila ! \n\n.:...............................................................................:.\n ^                                                                               ^\n   RELEASE NOTES:\n\n   Updated MC360 Skin to SVN Revision 33\n   Updated Apple Movie Trailers to SVN Revision 687\n   Updated YouTube to SVN Revision 687\n   Updated XBMCScripts Installer to V 1.7    \n\n.:...............................................................................:.\n ^                                                                               ^\n   CHANGELOG:\n\n   These are the topmost 3 lines of the changes included in this Release.   \n   You can find the complete Changelogs in /docs/Changelog.txt.\n   \n   2007-03-03  8004  changed: removed unused functions in IPlayer changed:\n                     moved hack for unpausing player before seek into players\n                     that need it instead of global added: frame stepping for\n                     mplayer (thnx to asteron for idea and initial patch) added:\n                     preliminary code for framestepping in dvdplayer, currently\n                     disabled as it causes audio desync on unpause.\n   2007-03-03  8003  fixed: XBMC_PC didn&amp;#039;t show the Internet sate due to System\n                     Info changes.\n   2007-03-03  8002  added: CPU idle thread with HLT instruction to cool and\n                     lower energy usage.
