The true story is even more epic than the new Spielberg feature film. It is told using rarely seen archive footage and rare archive testimony from First World War veterans who worked with horses, and sequences with experts such as former RSPCA Chief Vet Mark Evans, historian Richard van Emden and British Army expert Dr David Kenyon, combined with the latest historical research. The story begins with the mass call-up of horses from every farm and country estate in the land. Racing commentator Brough Scott tells the tale of his aristocratic grandfather General Jack Seely and his beloved horse Warrior, who would become the most famous horse of the war, renowned for his amazing courage, and becoming a mascot to the troops.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2f389d282f05688cc95ada3198a744ea7fdc647","amp;dn":"The+Real+War+Horse+%28Channel+4+-+2012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2f389d282f05688cc95ada3198a744ea7fdc647","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,243,137,210,130,240,86,136,204,149,173,163,25,138,116,78,167,253,198,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
