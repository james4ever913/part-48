Everyone from Clapton to KISS did it, except us. That's ironic, considering ApologetiX co-founders J. Jackson and Karl Messner met each other in 1990 and played a lot of acoustic stuff in their early days at Bible studies before taking the name &quot;AologetiX&quot; ... and at plenty of coffee houses afterward till the band started touring on a national scale in the mid-90's.\n\nOf course, we wouldn't be too keen on releasing any of those old performances. We wish we'd known then what we know now in terms of playing, singing, songwriting and recording. Well, we can't rewrite history. However, we can rewrite, re-perform, and re-record some of those old songs (and some newer ones), being able to apply a decade and a half's worth of experience. So that's what we did on &quot;Apol-acoustiX.&quot;\n\nWe hope you'll enjoy this trip down memory lane with us. We repaved the roads for you, so it'll be a much smoother ride.\n\nThis project was recorded in January 2005 at ApologetiX Studios in Southwestern Pennsylvania. The photos herein were taken on a recording break by Karl's sister, Z, and Karl's wife, Deb, in front of Z's shop in Dormont, PA, and at the Eat n' Park restaurant where J. &amp; Karl christened the band &quot;ApologetiX&quot; 13 years earlier. Believe it or not, when we tried to get a local newspaper from the machine in front of the restaurant, the headline said &quot;Deja vu.&quot; God has a great sense of humor. Then  again, we've always believed that, and that's one of the reasons we do what we do.\n\nFifteen years after its foundation was laid, the mission of ApologetiX remains the same: &quot;to reach the lost and teach the rest.&quot; Some things don't need to change, no matter how many times you revisit them. \n\n\nTORRENTED BY:\n\nTorrent Tracts, April 2009\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7839bc24994f4ab0990fdb969d6c1e1d795f4270","amp;dn":"Apologetix+-+2005+-+Apol-Acoustix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7839bc24994f4ab0990fdb969d6c1e1d795f4270","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,57,188,36,153,79,74,176,153,15,219,150,157,108,30,29,121,95,66,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
