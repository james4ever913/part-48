In 2004 the brothers Samuel (guitar) and Daniel BorÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©n (drums) started the band together. Inspired by melodic hardrock/aor bands such as Magnum, Journey, Foreigner, Asia, FM, Survivor and many many others we started out trying to write some tunes and find some more members to the band. In 2006 we recorded our first demo ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRescue meÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with the singer Rolle and the bassist Amir under the bandname ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSaints and SinnersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. This line up didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t last with Rolle leaving the band after the summer of 2006. With both having lost our singer and not yet found a good keyboard player we were pretty down and out. By a coincidence Daniel ended up in the same car going home after a concert with Europe as Magnus GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ransson. Magnus started singing along to some Whitesnake tunes in the car and it didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t take long before he got a call from the BorÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©n brothers. Magnus agreed to join the band. Then just before we were playing our first concert in the 2007 edition of the band competition ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRockkarusellenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ we had some more luck and found Emil Jonsson on the internet. With just one rehearsal with the band before the concert he came in and did a great job. So in 2007 we put Magnus vocals and EmilÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s keyboards on the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRescue meÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ demo and then started work on new songs. In 2008 we did a second try in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRockkarusellenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, mainly to get some more live experience, now with our new bassist HÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥kan LethojÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤rvi added to the lineup. Before this new demo was finally recorded we decided to change the bandname to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTurbulenceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. The new demo ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWalk through fireÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was released okt-08.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef8fa003bb80a7cac156a8b6d3b5e28a4449404c","amp;dn":"Turbulence-Walk_Through_Fire-2008-TTi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef8fa003bb80a7cac156a8b6d3b5e28a4449404c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,143,160,3,187,128,167,202,193,86,168,182,211,181,226,138,68,73,64,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
