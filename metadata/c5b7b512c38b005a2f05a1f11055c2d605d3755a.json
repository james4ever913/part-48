Well, Josiah demonstrates! They sound as British as parsnips or a cup of Lady/Earl Grey, served with scones. Okay, one of them is born in the USA (I though I tasted something sour!).\n\nJosiah is what you can expect of a typical UK rock band: no worries, no hassle, just deliver the goods. Josiah takes the road that Black Sabbath abandoned after ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Master Of RealityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, and fits in the juicy sludgy sound of MotÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rhead. Once in a while a Paradise Lost solo flies in for the kill! Groove and rhythm are all to them, and the heavy sound that accompanies it just fits like a glove. This is StonerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ NÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Roll to the top! Listen to the swinging ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Long Time BurningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. Most song arte mid-tempo but they do accelerate in f.i. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Time To KillÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, what calls NWOBHM Hollow Ground to mind. The opposite is true as well, like in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“My Bird Of PreyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢. For lovers of stoner, doom and rock bands like Rose Tattoo, Led Zeppelin and previous mentioned bands, this CD is something to look out for. \n\n&quot;UK power trio Josiah are back with another impeccable hard rocking album. These guys are not only talented musicians, but they're even stronger songwriters. For hair swinging, riff-based metal with plenty of fuzzy distortion, wah pedals, and a thunderous rhythm section, they simply can't be beat. The grooves are irresistible, and needless to say they're not afraid of the cowbell. This is superb value: bright, well-produced, and beautifully played, cleaving to the values that made (and make) rock great.
