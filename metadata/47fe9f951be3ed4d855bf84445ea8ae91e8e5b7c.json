Thousands of Egyptian workers walked off the job Wednesday demanding better wages and benefits. Strikes were reported in Cairo, Alexandria, Luxor and the Suez Canal. We speak to Stanford University Professor Joel Beinin, who as the former director of Middle East Studies at the American University in Cairo has closely studied the Egyptian labor movement for years. &quot;This is huge because for the last 10 years there has been enormous wave of labor protests in Egypt,&quot; Beinin says. &quot;In the last few days what you have seen is tens of thousands of workers linking their economic demands to the political demands that the Mubarak regime step aside.&quot;\n\n\n- Defying Regime Threats, Thousands of Workers Join Protesters in Tahrir Square\n\nReporting from Cairo, Democracy Now! Senior Producer Sharif Abdel Kouddous says thousands of workers, including doctors and lawyers, have joined the protests in Tahrir Square. The demonstrators continue to flood the streets despite government threats and just one day before what is expected to the largest day of protests to date.\n\n\n- Bush's Shrinking World: George W. Bush Cancels Europe Trip Over Threatened Legal Action On Torture\n\nFormer President George W. Bush has been forced to cancel a planned trip to Switzerland after human rights attorneys threatened to take legal action against him for sanctioning the use of torture. The Center for Constitutional Rights said they had planned to bring a complaint on behalf of two men who were tortured by U.S. interrogators and held at the military base at GuantÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡namo Bay, Cuba. &quot;It's disappointing we weren't able to actually prosecute him,&quot; says CCR Legal Director Bill Quigley. &quot;But I think it has shown worldwide, that even though he was the president of the United States, if you engage in torture... there are consequences.&quot;\n\n\n- Human Rights Attorney Bill Quigley on the U.S. Deportation Death Sentence and the Undermining of Meaningful Elections in Haiti\n\nThe Obama administration has resumed deporting Haitian immigrants to Haiti despite a cholera outbreak there that has killed at least 4,000 people. Last month, 34-year-old Wildrick Guerrier died of cholera-like symptoms shortly after he was deported from the United States. The U.S. government meanwhile remains opposed to the return of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide despite authorization by the Haitian government, while pushing a run-off election vote marred by controversy including the exclusion of Aristide's Famni Lavalas party in the opening round.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.democracynow.org&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47fe9f951be3ed4d855bf84445ea8ae91e8e5b7c","amp;dn":"Democracy+Now+-+10+feb+2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47fe9f951be3ed4d855bf84445ea8ae91e8e5b7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,254,159,149,27,227,237,77,133,91,248,68,69,234,138,233,30,142,91,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
