The method is simple, straightforward and effective for all styles and all levels. With this video, you will get the sound out of your instrument that you have been looking for.\n\n\nTuning is crucial. The problem is, there&amp;#039;s really little information out there on this topic. Gatzen&amp;#039;s video is somewhat dry, and much of it seems improvised, but if you&amp;#039;re starting from ground zero or if you haven&amp;#039;t tuned your drums before it&amp;#039;s a very good way to establish your confidence in taking the drum keys out and tuning your drums. He&amp;#039;s got an extremely useful technique, he&amp;#039;s obviously an expert in his field, and the information is useful. I gave this video four stars because I don&amp;#039;t know where else you&amp;#039;ll find this information. Hopefully, either Gatzen will produce an update to this video or someone will do an even more extensive job, but until then this is a very good place to start.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6edd26dc951ca994c55d63fdf84d0c79e9300014","amp;dn":"Bob+Gatzen+Drum+Tuning+Sound+and+Design+-+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6edd26dc951ca994c55d63fdf84d0c79e9300014","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,221,38,220,149,28,169,148,197,93,99,253,248,77,12,121,233,48,0,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
