Unlike many torrent clients, it does not hog valuable system resources - typically using less than 6MB of memory, allowing you to use the computer as if it weren't there at all. \nAdditionally, the program itself is contained within a single executable less than 220 KB in size.\n\nSkinnable and Localized\nVarious icon, toolbar graphic and status icon replacements are available, and creating your own is very simple. \nÃƒâ€šÃ‚ÂµTorrent also has support for localization, and with a language file present, will automatically switch to your system language. \nIf your language isn't available, you can easily add your own, or edit other existing translations to improve them!\n\nActively Developed and Improved\nThe developer puts in a lot of time working on features and making things more user-friendly. Releases only come out when they're ready, with no schedule pressures, so the few bugs that appear are quickly addressed and fixed.\n\n\nChangelog:\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6171cee447c79b086c33a6e60fcb41bea529378d","amp;dn":"uTorrent+1.8.2+%28build+15296%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6171cee447c79b086c33a6e60fcb41bea529378d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,113,206,228,71,199,155,8,108,51,166,230,15,203,65,190,165,41,55,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
