Signed to Accolade, the pop imprint of EMI-Parlophone, they set about creating their image and sound.\n\nThe band\\\\\\&amp;#039;s name \\\\\\&amp;#039;Scooch\\\\\\&amp;#039; comes from a term used to ask someone to move up or along a bench or sofa.\n\n\n\nCareer:\n\nScooch won a contest on the BBC Television Saturday morning show Live &amp; Kicking in 1999. They competed against a boyband to have their single released. Even though the bands were already formed, this contest was unique as it pre-dates the format of the first music talent reality show, ITV\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Popstars in 2000, from which the band Hear?Say was created.\n\nTheir debut single \\\\\\&quot;When My Baby\\\\\\&quot; charted within the Top 40. This prompted a tour supporting the Irish girl group B*Witched, and promoted their second and biggest single \\\\\\&quot;More Than I Needed To Know\\\\\\&quot;. It entered the UK Singles Chart at number 5, and went on to see a global release (including Japan where it hit the top of the chart).\n\nA promotional support tour for boy band Five provided the group with the foundation for their third single \\\\\\&quot;The Best Is Yet To Come\\\\\\&quot; which charted at number 12 in the UK. The group recorded their debut album Welcome To The Planet Pop which was released to Top 20 success in Japan.\n\nThe fourth and final single from Scooch came in the form of the flamenco-inspired \\\\\\&quot;For Sure\\\\\\&quot; which made number 15 - it was followed by the UK version of their album entitled Four Sure which peaked just outside the UK Top 40.\n\n\n\nEnd of The Band:\n\nIn September 2000, EMI-Parlophone terminated their contract and, for personal reasons, the group decided against seeking renewal elsewhere.\n\n\n\nRe-Formation:\n\nThey reformed in January 2004 to perform at G-A-Y\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Gone But Not Forgotten night in front of a crowd of excited fans. The success of this prompted the band to do a tour of several gay venues and events around the country.\n\n\n\nEurovision Song Contest 2007:\nMYMU final results confusion\n\n\nOn 28 February 2007, it was announced that Scooch were to reform for a Eurovision Song Contest bid.\n\nThe group appeared in the UK selection competition Making Your Mind Up on BBC One on Saturday 17 March 2007, singing and performing their song Flying the Flag (For You). The show began with six songs, which were reduced to two songs after the public had voted, the four songs with the fewest votes leaving the competition. The remaining two songs went head to head in a \\\\\\&quot;sing-off\\\\\\&quot; and the public voted again for the outright winner.\n\nThe show ended in controversy as the result was announced. Fearne Cotton revealed the winner to be Scooch while, simultaneously, co-host Terry Wogan announced the winner to be fellow entry Cyndi. After several seconds of confusion and celebration from Cyndi caused by Wogan shouting louder than Cotton, it was revealed that Scooch were the true winners of the competition.\n\n\n\nDiscography:\n\n    Singles:\n\n    * \\\\\\&quot;When My Baby\\\\\\&quot; - #29 in October 1999\n    * \\\\\\&quot;More Than I Needed To Know\\\\\\&quot; - #5 in January 2000, #1 in Japan\n    * \\\\\\&quot;The Best Is Yet To Come\\\\\\&quot; - #12 in April 2000\n    * \\\\\\&quot;For Sure\\\\\\&quot; - #15 in July 2000\n    * \\\\\\&quot;Flying the Flag (for You)\\\\\\&quot; - 7th August 2007\n\n    Album:\n\n    * Four Sure - #41 in August 2000\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:395d9aa82fd5e5821b12faf6392cc3ae5e2d8a35","amp;dn":"SCOOCH+-+FOR+SURE+album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"395d9aa82fd5e5821b12faf6392cc3ae5e2d8a35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,93,154,168,47,213,229,130,27,18,250,246,57,44,195,174,94,45,138,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
