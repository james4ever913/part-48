Young undercover cop Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is assigned to infiltrate the mob syndicate run by gangland chief Costello (Jack Nicholson). While Billy is quickly gaining Costello\\&amp;#039;s confidence, Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon), a hardened young criminal who has infiltrated the police department as an informer for the syndicate, is rising to a position of power in the Special Investigation Unit. Each man becomes deeply consumed by his double life, gathering information about the plans and counter-plans of the operations he has penetrated. But when it becomes clear to both the gangsters and the police that there\\&amp;#039;s a mole in their midst, Billy and Colin are suddenly in danger of being caught and exposed to the enemy -- and each must race to uncover the identity of the other man in time to save himself. \n \n\nStarring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Jack Nicholson  \nDirected by: Martin Scorsese  \nProduced by: Roy Lee, Doug Davison, Gianni Nunnari  \n\n\nGenres: Action/Adventure, Drama, Thriller, Crime/Gangster and Remake \n \nRunning Time: 2 hrs. 30 min. \n \nRelease Date: October 6th, 2006 (wide) \n \nMPAA Rating: R for strong brutal violence, pervasive language, some strong sexual content and drug material. \n \nDistributors: Warner Bros.
