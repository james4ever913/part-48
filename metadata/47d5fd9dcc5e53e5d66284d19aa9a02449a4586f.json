The family home is in a very remote and isolated area. While back home, Ned starts having memories of his beautiful twin sister and himself when they were children. These memories awaken long-buried secrets from the familyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s past.\n\nGenre: Drama | Mystery\nIMDB rating: 7,1/10\nDirected by: Rachel Ward\nStarring: Rachel Griffiths, Bryan Brown\n\n*** Small-sized 2-pass re-encode of DVD rip for computers (PC, Mac), PS3 or Xbox, portable and mobile devices (Ipod, Itouch) . ***\n*** Video is 480x272 H264; audio is 44.1 kHz/stereo AAC LC and container is MP4. ***\n\nI can recommend CoreCodec for H264 (avc1, x264) video-playback, free DivX 7 for AAC sound-playback (and .mkv with AAC), Haali splitter (free, comes with CoreCodec) as the fastest and best combination for Windows Media Player. This is what I use.\nVLC player (free), mplayer (free) and KMplayer (free) are available as alternative for all platforms (operating systems) out there and have BUILT-IN codecs and MP4 capabilities. But, video quality is approx. 10-15% lower, blurrier at least on system I have.\nOne can try CCCP matroska codec pack, where ffdshow codec/filter packs and Haali splitter comes in one package and support MP4 playback - but extra caution is required during the install process.\nQuickTime of course, supports H264/AAC natively.\nPS3 + HDMI cable + newer TV have been reported as best combination.\nAnd please, do not watch it with a nose in the screen, take proper distance to the monitor or TV (as advised in TV manuals).Many of movies I encode have embedded subtitles. So far, only VLC player is able to use them correctly.\n\nUSE TORRENT-SEARCH SITES, TorrentBar extension for FireFox OR EVEN GOOGLE: show-name H264\n(for example GOSSIP GIRL H264).\n\n&quot;Home&quot; of my torrents (for Bookmark/Favorites in your browser) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/twentyforty&lt;/a&gt;\n\nInteresting &quot;Discussion&quot; to follow: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5191311/Cloudy.With.A.Chance.Of.Meatballs.PROPER.H264&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5191311/Cloudy.With.A.Chance.Of.Meatballs.PROPER.H264&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5190694/The.Bad.Lieutenant.Port.of.Call.New.Orleans.LIMITED.H264&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5190694/The.Bad.Lieutenant.Port.of.Call.New.Orleans.LIMITED.H264&lt;/a&gt;\nYour comments and opinions are welcomed, good and the bad ones.\n\nInput: Beautiful.Kate.2009.DVDRip.XviD-aAF\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47d5fd9dcc5e53e5d66284d19aa9a02449a4586f","amp;dn":"Beautiful.Kate.2009.DVDRip.H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47d5fd9dcc5e53e5d66284d19aa9a02449a4586f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,213,253,157,204,94,83,229,214,98,132,209,154,169,160,36,73,164,88,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
