Bhuvanesh Komkali takes us back for a retrospective look into his grandfather, Kumar Gandharva's probe of musical roots. He analyses what made Kumarji's singing the way it was and the reason for it being an inspiration and beacon to coming generations of musicians. He talks of Kumar Gandharva as not a singing legend but as musicologist too. 'Hans Akela' defying the traditional norms of a documentary becomes a delightful journey into the world of the singing legend Kumar Gandharva who not only defied the norms of traditional Hindustani Classical but critically analyzed traditional Hindustani Classical before revolutionizing it. Highlighting on the various facades of his life, his work and his music are friends, family, followers and fans. A treasure trove of information, incidents, photographs and some rare footage unravels through these people who at some points in their lives or Kumarji's have been a part of his art and his life\n\n\nBorn in 1942, Maharashtra, Dr Patel is pediatrician by education and runs a polyclinic at Daund, on the outskirts of Pune, with his wife, a gynecologist.
