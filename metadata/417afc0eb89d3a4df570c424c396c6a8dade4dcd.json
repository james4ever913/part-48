Well, look out, because we've got a live one here!\n\nAfter close to 800 shows, it's about time. Actually, the very first ApologetiX recording to hit mass circulation was a homemade live cassette called Get Your Wigs. There were only a few hundred copies made, so don't look for it. Seriously... don't!\n\nLast year, when we released New &amp; Used Hits: The Best of ApologetiX Vol. 1 &amp; 2, we elected to include eight live tracks, because we felt our live performances were superior to the original. This new CD, ApologetiX Hits: The Road contains 20 live tracks (including three parodies that have never appeared on any ApologetiX CD), but none of the songs that appeared in live format on New &amp; Used Hits.\n\nApologetiX Hits: The Road is a celebration of our busiest tour ever?the one we kicked off in support of New &amp; Used Hits. That CD was released at two concerts at the Cup O' Joy in Green Bay WI, on November 27, 2004. We finished that tour exactly 364 days later at the same venue on November 26, 2005.\n\nDuring that 365-day period, we played 102 concerts in the following 32 states:\n\nAlabama, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho,\nIllinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin, and\nWest Virginia.\n\nFor the record, the live performances on ApologetiX Hits: The Road were recorded during that tour at concerts in Greenfield IN, Kewanee IL, Springfield MO, Moravia NY, Newark DE, and Green Bay WI.\n\nIf you've been to one of our concerts (or 40 of them, like some of our fans), this CD will give you a keepsake to remember the fun you had until we meet again. If you haven't been to one yet, this CD will give you a taste of what's in store for you. Make sure you pick up the companion DVD, Samson Comes Alive: An Evening with ApologetiX, featuring live footage of the first 17 songs on this CD (plus three others), interviews with the guys, and the zany stage antics during and between\nsongs that didn't make it onto the CD.\n\nSee you soon. It's time for us to hit the road again!\n\n\nTORRENTED BY:\n\nTorrent Tracts, April 2009\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:417afc0eb89d3a4df570c424c396c6a8dade4dcd","amp;dn":"Apologetix+-+2005+-+Hits+The+Road","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"417afc0eb89d3a4df570c424c396c6a8dade4dcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,122,252,14,184,157,58,77,245,112,196,36,195,150,198,168,218,222,77,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
