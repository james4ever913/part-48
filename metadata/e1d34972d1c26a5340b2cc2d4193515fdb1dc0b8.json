It was released as the fourth single from the band's self-titled 1985 album Heart, and the fourth song from the album to hit the U.S. top-ten, peaking at number ten on the Billboard Hot 100. It failed to reach the Top 75 in the UK, hitting number 76 in the UK Singles Chart, however a re-issue released in 1988 reached number 38.\n\nLyrically it is a love song which describes a new relationship which falls into place without effort or conflict. When singer Ann Wilson asks the song's subject what he did to make falling in love so easy, his response is &quot;nothin' at all&quot;. The song's music video received heavy rotation on MTV and this single was the last big hit from the Heart album.\n\nHeart is the self-titled eighth studio album, but ninth album overall, released by Heart. Released in 1985, the album completed the band's transition into a pop group, a genre that yielded the band its greatest success by far, marking the band's Capitol Records debut, and it spent 92 weeks on the U.S. Billboard 200 and became the only album of the band's to hit number one. Sales reached quintuple platinum, after a previous lull. It also yielded the first number-one single for the band: &quot;These Dreams&quot;. There were also four other hit singles on the album: &quot;If Looks Could Kill&quot;, &quot;What About Love&quot;, &quot;Never&quot;, and &quot;Nothin' at All&quot;. The latter three also made the U.S. top ten.\n\nHeart is a rock band whose founding members came from Seattle, Washington, USA  in the early 1970s. Going through several lineup changes, the only constant members of the group are sisters Ann and Nancy Wilson. The group rose to fame in the 1970s with their music being influenced by hard rock as well as folk music. After diminishing in popularity by the mid-1980s, the band created a major comeback in 1985, experiencing further success with their power ballads throughout the rest of the decade. By the mid-1990s, Heart left their 1980s' sound and went back to their hard rock roots which they continue to play today. To date, Heart has sold over 35 million albums worldwide.\n\nAfter a six-year hiatus, Heart will return with a new studio recording in 2010, entitled Red Velvet Car.\n\nHeart was ranked #57 on VH1's &quot;100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock&quot;.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1d34972d1c26a5340b2cc2d4193515fdb1dc0b8","amp;dn":"Heart+-+Nothin%5C%27+At+All++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1d34972d1c26a5340b2cc2d4193515fdb1dc0b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,211,73,114,209,194,106,83,64,178,204,45,65,147,81,95,219,29,192,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
