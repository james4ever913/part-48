All in PDF with NFO files on some of the composers in Swedish, German or English.\n\nThe Age of Liberty (Sw. Frihetstiden) streched from 1719, when queen Ulrika Eleonora resigned the throne in favour of her husband, Fredrik I (who was forced to accept a decentralised system with more power shifted towards the State Council (Sw. RiksrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥det) and a much stronger parliament), up until Gustaf III's 'courtyard cuop d'ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©tat' (Sw. borggÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¥rdskuppen) in 1772.\n\nThe importance of Gustaf III (reg. 1771-1792) regarding the status and quality of the fine arts in Sweden is well known (at least in Sweden), but the preceding years did provide a base on which Gustaf III could build his cultural institutions. This is a compilation I have made based upon Project Runeberg's project with the same name, Music of The Age of Liberty. I have added sheets from my own collection as well as my own arrangement of Lidner's DeÃƒÆ’Ã…Â¸ Geistes frucht for piano and voice (based upon an orchestral setting by Johan Tufvesson). It is also an updated version compared to the previous torrent with the same theme, that I uploaded a while ago (and which I have deleted).\n\nThis small collection is ideal for anyone studying or with an interest in Sweden of the mid 18th century.\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nThe composers represented are\n\nAgrell, Johan Joachim\nBrant, Per\nChelleri, Fortunato\nJohnsen, Hinrich Philip\nLidner, Bengt\nRoman, Johan Helmich\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nNB! Since my connection is rather slow, please be patient.\nI will have to turn off my computer for the night (CET)\nand I need you to help me seed upon completion!\n\nThanks :)\n\nLakritslemmel","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8dc3c26a960863044828976a47f3114586de7fdd","amp;dn":"Sheet+Music%3A+Musik+fr%C3%83%C2%A5n+Frihetstiden%2FMusic+from+The+Age+of+Libe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8dc3c26a960863044828976a47f3114586de7fdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,195,194,106,150,8,99,4,72,40,151,106,71,243,17,69,134,222,127,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
