What He spoke about Himself must be true. He made Himself known as The Creator, The One, The Originator, and The Provider. He is the First, nothing is before Him; The Last, nothing is after Him; The Most High, nothing is above Him; The Most Near, nothing is beyond His reach, and He encompasses everything while He is above heavens, distinct and separate from His creatures. Great in His Majesty and Honor, Most Merciful, Severe in Punishment, All-Knower, Most Compassionate, All-Wise, and All-Just; Most Perfect in all of His Names and Attributes. He does not beget, nor is He begotten. There is no equal to Him, and there is nothing like unto him, and thus He alone deserves to be worshipped. In essence, the religion as revealed1 to nations before us and to mankind up to the Day of Resurrection, calls for the worship of none but God (Allah).\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ee2fc97dc0bd4f71fffc9ec03e6709e4ba03ca8","amp;dn":"Some+Sincere+Advice+To+Every+Christian","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ee2fc97dc0bd4f71fffc9ec03e6709e4ba03ca8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,226,252,151,220,11,212,247,31,255,201,236,3,230,112,158,75,160,60,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
