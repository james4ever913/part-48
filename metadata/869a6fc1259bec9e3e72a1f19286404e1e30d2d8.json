The photographic colors are brilliantly choreographed to the mood of character and viewer. The visionary landscapes are mesmerizing beautiful.\n\nThe survival techniques the characters in the film achieve is unlike anything I've seen in film. Much like Kubrick in terms of directive style and character study, Tarkovsky puts the viewer in a kaleidoscopic landscape of mood and emotion. No clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s here though. I have not read the story which the movie is based upon, but from what I understand the characters in the film all develop a healing understanding of each other.\n\nThat is when you know [as a viewer] that you will watch something unique and\n\nexceptional. If you are into complex, psychological science fiction in the same vain of say {The Andromeda Strain, Solaris, 2001:a space odyssey} than you shall enjoy &quot;Stalker&quot;. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:869a6fc1259bec9e3e72a1f19286404e1e30d2d8","amp;dn":"Stalker+%281979%29+GERMAN+H264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"869a6fc1259bec9e3e72a1f19286404e1e30d2d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,154,111,193,37,155,236,158,62,114,161,241,146,134,64,78,30,48,210,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
