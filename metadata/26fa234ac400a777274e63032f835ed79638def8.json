They rob a soda truck and shoot the truck's driver while still in their early teens. The robbery money is used to purchase visas to go the United States, where they continue their criminal activities, hustling on the streets of Miami. Wayne is then deported to Jamaica and continues his surge in crime, where he begins to extort money from business people. Bigs gets deported a few years later. After a while, they both head back to the US with some of their cronies and continue stealing, targeting drug dealers. The drug dealers decide to put up a strong resistance to the two.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26fa234ac400a777274e63032f835ed79638def8","amp;dn":"Shottas+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26fa234ac400a777274e63032f835ed79638def8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,250,35,74,196,0,167,119,39,78,99,3,47,131,94,215,150,56,222,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
