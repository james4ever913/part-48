It is comprised almost entirely of  media in the public domain, featuring many of the gialli classics by Dario Argento, which have inexplicably drifted into free waters.  Well, praise Jesus because most the other films are crap, but I did the best I could with the available material.  I attended a 35mm screening of Night of the Hunter which they kicked off with a Bugs Bunny cartoon, so that's why it kicks things off; apparently no matter what the content they used to begin films with a cartoon.\n\nCentral Idea:\nThe initial plot concerns a series of murders by the &quot;Cul-de-sac Killer,&quot; but it is apparent that he is just one of the many at work in the public domain.  The plot disintegrates almost as soon as it began once the film itself has a Crisis.  The rest is Suppression, then Release.\n\nIt could always use a little tinkering, but I've got to focus on my other darlings so if there are enough people interested, I can seed the whole project folder with the master files and you can tweak it as you see fit.  All you would need is Photoshop and Vegas; feel free to do whatever you want, I only ask that you focus on material in the public domain.  Hope you enjoy.\n\nThe mpeg2 version I have is better quality but three times the size and my upload capabilities suck; I'm pretty sure Verizon lowered their standard DSL speed to make FiOS, which isn't available in my area, more lucrative.  Shame on them.  So be patient at first, until others grab it-- and hopefully they won't delete it right away.  This torrent is aimed at cinemageddon fellows and the freakyflicks faithful right here at TPB.\n\n***CAUTION***\nVery graphic stuff featuring flashes of crime-scene photographs, so not for the squeamish.\n\n--- Video Information ---                                                       \nVideo Codec Type(e.g. &quot;DIV3&quot;):                  XVID              \nVideo Codec Name(e.g. &quot;DivX 3, Low-Motion&quot;):    XviD 1.1.0 Beta 2              \nVideo Codec Status(e.g. &quot;Codec Is Installed&quot;):  Codec(s) are Installed            \nDuration (hh:mm:ss):                            1:12:01                \nFrame Count:                                    129484             \nFrame Width (pixels):                           720                  \nFrame Height (pixels):                          480                  \nStorage Aspect Ratio(&quot;SAR&quot;)&quot;                    1.500                     \nPixel Aspect Ratio (&quot;PAR&quot;):                     1.000                     \nDisplay Aspect Ratio (&quot;DAR&quot;):                   1.500                     \nFields Per Second:                                        \nFrames Per Second:                              29.970          \nPics Per Second:                                29.970            \nVideo Bitrate (kbps):                           1042                 \nMPEG-4 (&quot;MPEG-4&quot; or &quot;&quot;):                        MPEG-4                   \nB-VOP (&quot;B-VOP&quot; or &quot;&quot;):                          B-VOP              \n   \n                                                                                \n--- Audio Information ---                                                       \nMPEG Stream ID (e.g. &quot;0xbd&quot;):                             \nMPEG VOB file Substream(e.g. &quot;0x80&quot;):                  \nAudio Codec (e.g. &quot;AC3&quot;):                       PCM Audio                   \nAudio Codec Status (e.g. &quot;Codec Is Installed&quot;): No Codec Required            \nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):                         48000             \nAudio Bitrate(kbps):                            1536                 \nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):                        \nAudio Channel Count (e.g. &quot;2&quot; for stereo):      2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3df4c9b7c373a22e4970deb1f5119aa656ad2729","amp;dn":"The+Public+Domain+%5B2009%5D+XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3df4c9b7c373a22e4970deb1f5119aa656ad2729","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,244,201,183,195,115,162,46,73,112,222,177,245,17,154,166,86,173,39,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
