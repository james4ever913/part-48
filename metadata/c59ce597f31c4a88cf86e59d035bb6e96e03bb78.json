Heck, I recommend this series to anyone. If you like sports (especially boxing), you will love the authenticity in which the animators present the boxing concepts and realism, not to mention the gradual development of the protagonist, Ippo Makunouchi. In addition,all the other characters are well-developed, so well-developed that you might even cheer for the guy Ippo is fighting. If you just like animÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© in general, this series has superior animation. You could feel the punches grinding on the boxer's bodies. If you are a newcomer, fear not. This series is one of the funniest animÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©s ever. This is an overall superior animÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©. If you never watched animÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© in your life, or just looking for a good series to watch, this is it.&quot; by author superpogimax (IMDb)\n\nUser Rating: 9.1/10 (399 votes) as of 1/04/2010 (IMDb)\n\nMPEG-4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c59ce597f31c4a88cf86e59d035bb6e96e03bb78","amp;dn":"Fighting+Spirit+Vol.+3-Test+of+Endurance+%28Anime%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c59ce597f31c4a88cf86e59d035bb6e96e03bb78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,156,229,151,243,28,74,136,207,134,229,157,3,91,182,233,110,3,187,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
