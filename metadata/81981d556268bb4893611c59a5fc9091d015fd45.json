Lewis and the Case against Scientism:\nMore than a half century ago, famed writer C.S. Lewis warned about how science (a good thing) could be twisted in order to attack religion, undermine ethics, and limit human freedom. In this documentary &quot;The Magician's Twin: C.S. Lewis and the Case Against Scientism,&quot; leading scholars explore Lewis's prophetic warnings about the abuse of science and how Lewis's concerns are increasingly relevant for us today.\n\nThis week marks the 50th anniversary of the death of beloved writer C.S. Lewis. &quot;C.S. Lewis and Intelligent Design&quot; is the third of three short documentaries inspired by the book The Magician's Twin: C.S. Lewis on Science, Scientism, and Society. Lewis is best known for his magical stories about Narnia, but a new documentary explores his life-long struggle to find intelligent design in a world filled with pain.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe War on Humans:\nAre humans the enemy? Should pigs and peas have constitutional rights? The War on Humans is a 31-minute documentary that critiques growing efforts to disparage the value of humans in the name of saving the planet. The documentary investigates the views of anti-human activists who want to grant legal rights to animals, plants, and &quot;Mother Earth,&quot; and who want to reduce the human population by up to 90%. The video features Discovery Institute Senior Fellow Wesley J. Smith, author of a companion e-book with the same title.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPhenomenum Lost Archives 6 - Science Fraud, Is the Tail Wagging the Dog:\nA documentary series that takes an in-depth look at the topics found in recently de-classified government documents. It explores well-known issues with new information that has been sequestered from the public for over sixty years.\n\nThis episode deals with the ever-increasing scientific fraud that plagues society.  It discusses many documented incidences, various motives, and etc. which have occurred in most major fields of science and the influence of corporations and governments.  Quite disturbing, indeed.  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHY EVOLUTION IS EVIL &amp; DANGEROUS with Dr. Kent Hovind:\nDr. Hovind lays down the law yet again as to why evil-ution is dangerous, and flat out wrong. Mass genocides, fascism, communism, socialism etc. all stem from evolution, and evolution came from the ass of Satan. . . and people eat that shit up. I hate cussing, but no words exist in the English language that properly emphasizes my passion for these topics.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDarwinism Under the Microscope - Lessons From History with Sylvia Baker: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://edinburghcreationgroup.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://edinburghcreationgroup.org&lt;/a&gt; Ã‡â‚¬ With the rise of genetics and molecular biology, evidence is emerging that Darwinism is not the unlimited process we once thought.\n\nSylvia Baker is a biology graduate of the University of Sussex and the University of London. She accepted the evolutionary theory put to her at school and at university - until the pressure of evidence forced her to rethink the whole question.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEVOLUTION IS A LIE - ILLUMINATI MASS COVER-UP:\nEvidence that evolution is a satanic agenda being crammed down our throats to indoctrinate the populace.  The evidence is quite outrageous, but why is the public so blind or why don't they care?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore videos contained in this download include...\nDo Creation Scientists Do Real Research - Creation Today\nMore viewer questions Genesis Week ep25 s3\nSeason 3 Premiere - Battle for the Bible - Creation Today\nVarious short Creation video clips\n2013 List of Not So Old Things audio\n\nAlso included are our End-Times and Xtras folders\n\nThis is in memory of my Mom who passed at 11:44 pm PST ON 1-25-2011.

He was buried and ROSE three days later, according to The Scriptures. Praise the Lord for HE HAS RISEN. I am now forgiven for my sins, past, present and future and can live on with the Lord in Eternity, forever.\n\nRAPtURE (My transportation outta here).\n\nThe Blessed Hope.  If you believe in The Rapture you better believe The Above Statement and that the Sacrificed Blood of Jesus, on the Cross paid for your sins and there is NOTHING Else you can do to gain Salvation, The GRACE of Christ did it ALL. Now you just have to believe that with all your Heart, Mind and Soul or Maybe Get Left Behind. All PAST, Present and Future Sins are Forgiven with Jesus. (I wouldn't PUSH That Future sin statement to much!!!)\n\nIn a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed...\n\n&quot;And He will send forth His angels with A GREAT TRUMPET and THEY WILL GATHER TOGETHER His elect from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.\n\n&quot;Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming, in which all who are in the tombs will hear His voice,  Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in The Air, and there we will be forever be with him...hmmm sounds like some of us might be Immortal. (Ask your preacher about that)\n\nMore Torrents in this series at http://conspiracyhub.com/membershares.php?it=41 ALL TORRENTS are RELEASED here FIRST!!!
