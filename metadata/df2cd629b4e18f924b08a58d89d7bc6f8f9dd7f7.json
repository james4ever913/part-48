The generation that led the Cuban revolution remains in power, as does the punitive US trade embargo. \n\nA year after President Obama came to power, relations with America's Communist neighbour are as strained as ever. With unprecedented access, Matt Frei reports on the reality of living inside Cuba, from the politics to economics, and discovers a vibrant culture that flourishes in the most unlikely circumstances.\n\n\n\nFile Name ..........: Our World - Inside Cuba-thebox.bz.avi\n\n\nSource: http://www.thebox.bz/details.php?id=112408\nCap: ottopilot \nOther shunster posts","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df2cd629b4e18f924b08a58d89d7bc6f8f9dd7f7","amp;dn":"Our+World+-+Inside+Cuba++2010+03++07+BBC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df2cd629b4e18f924b08a58d89d7bc6f8f9dd7f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,44,214,41,180,225,143,146,75,8,165,141,137,215,188,111,143,157,215,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
