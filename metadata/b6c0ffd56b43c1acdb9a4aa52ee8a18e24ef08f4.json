He witnesses his daughter, Pooja, being molested by Kali, the son of gangster Dhabla, objects to this behavior, but is silenced by Dhabla. Pooja is in love with a young man named Raja. One day Pooja is sexually assaulted by Kali and a group of his friends, who then throw her to her death from the roof of an under-construction building. Raja witnesses this, and reports this to the police. Inspector Shirke instead charges Raja for this crime. Pooja's brother, Vijay, finds out and attempts to try and put a stop to this injustice. Shortly thereafter Raja is killed, and Vijay is charged for killing him and held in a cell. The charge against Vijay is that he killed Raja out of anger for molesting his sister, a charge that may carry the death sentence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6c0ffd56b43c1acdb9a4aa52ee8a18e24ef08f4","amp;dn":"Anth+%281993%29+720p+BrRip+x264.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6c0ffd56b43c1acdb9a4aa52ee8a18e24ef08f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,192,255,213,107,67,193,172,219,154,74,165,46,232,161,142,36,239,8,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
