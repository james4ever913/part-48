Once the enveloping visual content has become the landscape of the mind to the viewer, the subliminal content will have access to the subconscious mind.ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¥  - Jack Sargeant\n\nÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£Accentuating the trioÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€œs vibrant performances with colorization, layered collages, dense textures and split-screen effects, Harmon becomes a virtual fourth member of the ensemble.ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¥  - All About Jazz, on Chronicle\n\nÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¿The subdued flame-like flashes and sounds reinforce the feeling of quietly smoldering passion.

By giving the public full access to this film I hope to encourage other filmmakers to realize the potential of their audience by abandoning the outdated model of cinematic distribution in favor of an open relationship with the viewers themselves.\n\nAfter years of struggle with the format of distribution cinema has found an ever evolving platform of distribution on the internet. Years of so called  ÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¿format warsÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€œ, first between film gauges and then between dv formats, have ended in the wake of widening broadband access for the average person.\n\nThe ability for anyone to simple download and watch a film already exists, as does the ability for anyone to make a film and allow the world to experience it directly. The filmmaker has a wide range of encoding practices available that allow them to maximize video quality for each projectÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€œs distribution on the web. As further technologies and better codecs are develop the filmmaker will be able to expand on the available sources for the cinematic presentation.\n\nAs much as the PhilosopherÃƒÅ½Ã¢â‚¬Å“ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬â€œs Stone visually represents a historic period in early 20th century cinema it looks forward to a future unfettered by lack of distribution and a platform for broadcast that gives everyone a chance to experience cinema to its fullest.\n\nThis film is meant as a mirror, reflecting what has been onto what will become.\n\nObviam lux Lucis\n\nRaymond Salvatore Harmon\nOctober 3rd - 2008\n\n2gb.\nIMG file of the DVD distribution\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02c6cdd5417ede9e0985a70fd3055f848372be86","amp;dn":"Raymond+Salvatore+Harmon%3A+The+Philosophers+Stone","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02c6cdd5417ede9e0985a70fd3055f848372be86","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,198,205,213,65,126,222,158,9,133,167,15,211,5,95,132,131,114,190,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
