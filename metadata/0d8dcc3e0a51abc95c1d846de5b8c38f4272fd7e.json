The song was a worldwide hit, reaching number two in the United Kingdom in 1989. The song was also a landmark release for the Belgian EBM- and New Beat-influenced house music. It was able to tackle the tough American market and became the first house song to break into mainstream. It reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100. The song was later certified triple platinum. In 2005, it was remixed by internationally renowned DJ/producer D.O.N.S. who took it to number one on the British Dance Chart.\n\n\n\nCover versions\n--------------\nIcelandic band FM Belfast made a slow electronica cover of &quot;Pump up the Jam&quot;. In 1990, it was parodied with virtually identical music as the German-language Pump ab das Bier (&quot;Pump away the beer!&quot;, urging a fellow barsitter to drink up) by Werner Wichtig, stage name for Raimund Thielcke, who actually had brewer training. The vocal has been sampled in the hardcore music Da pump by Da tekno warriors. In 1998 it was remixed by Crazy Frog on the 2005 album Crazy Frog Presents Crazy Hits. Quebec acoustic cover band The Lost Fingers recorded a cover of the song for their 2008 album Lost In The 80s. Kids Incorporated sang this song on the show's 7th season. In 2009 the song was interpolated by rapper Pitbull in the song B-Day Suit. In 1992, &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic made a short polka version for his medley &quot;Polka Your Eyes Out&quot;.\n\nCultural References\n-------------------\nThe song was the background music to a Saturday Night Live skit featuring Nancy Kerrigan figure skating with Chris Farley, to a scene in the 1996 movie Space Jam, where the Looney Tunes and Michael Jordan are getting ready to play basketball. It was also featured in the karaoke video game Singstar 90s, in a scene in the 2008 film You Don't Mess with the Zohan. The song was the basis for Soni De Nakhre, a Bollywood song featured in the movie Partner, which was itself loosely based on the movie Hitch. It was also used in a 2008 cellphone commercial in Argentina, which explained &quot;why translated songs aren't as good&quot;. The song was translated as &quot;Infla la mermelada&quot; (word by word, though not correctly, &quot;Pump the jam&quot;) The song is also featured in the Nintendo Wii game &quot;Just Dance&quot;. It was also used during the sketches between Victoria Silvstedt and Enrico Papi in the Italian TV show &quot;La Ruota Della Fortuna&quot;.\n\n\nLyrics\n------\nPump up the jam\npump it up\nwhy your feet are stomping?\nAnd the jam is pumping\nlook at it get the crowd jumpin'\n\npump it up a little more\nget the party goin' on the dance floor\nsee 'cause that's where the party's at and you fine dinning, to bad\n\n(chours)\nI want a place to say:\n&quot;get your booty on the floor tonight&quot;\nmake my day\nI want a place to say:\n&quot;get your booty on the floor tonight&quot;\nmake my day\n\nmake my day (x5)\n\nYo!
