Windows, by design, allows programs to monopolize your CPU without restraint -- leading to freezes and hangs. Process Lasso's ProBalance technology intelligently adjusts the priority of running programs so that badly behaved programs won't interfere with your ability to use the computer! In addition, Process Lasso offers capabilities such as default process priorities and affinities, termination of disallowed processes, instance count limits, a system responsiveness graph, logging of processes, and much more! Once you install Process Lasso, it'll just start working. More advanced users can tweak the configuration, but you needn't touch anything to have it instantly improve your system responsiveness and prevent stalls in high load situations.\n\nFeatures:\n ProBalance dynamic priority and affinity optimization\n Default process priorities\n Default process CPU affinities\n Foreground boosting\n Limit number of program instances\n Disallow programs from running\n Process logging\n System responsiveness graph\n Stand-alone core engine\n Available in x86-32 and x86-64 builds\n Much more...\n\nGraphical Interface Features:\n Easily set rules for default process priorities, affinities, and more\n Optionally show balloon tips to notify you when actions are taken\n Unique system responsiveness calculation and graph display\n Easy to use right-click menu system allows for modification of process rules (default priority, default affinity, startup at login, and more)\n When not visible, resource use is minimized through a sleep-like mode\n The GUI is not required for process management, it can be completely closed\n Much more...
