Horn 1 (2005)\n\nTrumpeter Maynard Ferguson began his successful &quot;comeback&quot; (after several years of low-profile activity) with this well-received Columbia LP. Featuring his English orchestra (and such soloists as altoist Pete King and Danny Moss on tenor), Ferguson had a minor hit in &quot;MacArthur Park,&quot; showcases some Indian musicians on &quot;Chala Nata,&quot; and shows throughout that his mind was open toward both newer forms of jazz and pop music. It's an interesting if unessential set. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Eli's Comin'\n02 - Ballad To Max\n03 - Macarthur Park\n04 - Chala Nata\n05 - If I Thought You'd Ever Change Your Mind\n06 - L-dopa\n\nSplit with Medieval. Sorry.\n\nEnjoy and share!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae57f46ee929ec2ef61639ca473d99d5ca9016a0","amp;dn":"Maynard+Ferguson+-+1970+-+M.F.+Horn+1+%282005%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae57f46ee929ec2ef61639ca473d99d5ca9016a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,87,244,110,233,41,236,46,246,22,57,202,71,61,153,213,202,144,22,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
