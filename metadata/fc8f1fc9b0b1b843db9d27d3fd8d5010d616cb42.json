Shostakovich's friend Isaak Glikman called the symphony &quot;his most tragic work&quot;.[1]\n\nmuzik62","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc8f1fc9b0b1b843db9d27d3fd8d5010d616cb42","amp;dn":"Shostakovich+-+Symphoni+No+8","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc8f1fc9b0b1b843db9d27d3fd8d5010d616cb42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,143,31,201,176,177,184,67,219,157,39,211,253,141,80,16,214,22,203,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
