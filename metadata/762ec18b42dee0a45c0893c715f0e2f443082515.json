You might hear it referred to as\ncomputer modding,case modding, or usually just modding, but its all the same. Just take a\ncomputer component or case and change it from its original form and you are now a modder.\nMods typically come in two varieties: functional and visual. Overclocking, or increasing airflow\nwould be a functional mod. A visual mod would include things like painting a case. The best\nmods include both aspects in a single package.\nModders are all around you every day, without your even realizing it. Every child or adult that\ntakes things apart just to see how they work is showing latent modding skills. Curiosity, challenge,\nstubbornness these are all the things that haunt and bless every modder out there.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:762ec18b42dee0a45c0893c715f0e2f443082515","amp;dn":"Going+Mod+9+Cool+Case+Mod+Projects+%28ExtremeTech+Series%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"762ec18b42dee0a45c0893c715f0e2f443082515","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,46,193,139,66,222,224,164,92,8,147,199,21,240,226,244,67,8,37,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
