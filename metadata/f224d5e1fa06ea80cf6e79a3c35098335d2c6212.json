His debut album as Squazoid is called Fantasia and is not just an album to enjoy, but one to experience. There is no dark, full on or goa style here...\n\nPsychedelic trance tracks with a fantasy theme full of colours and vibrations and a superb finish with a brilliant chill out psy-ethno end. It's a morning sound but kicks along with a power of its own. It's original and the sounds are really transporting making this a release that truly deserves the 'psychedelic' tag.\n\nThis is funky unique trance at its best!\n\nStyle: Psytrance\n\nReleased: Sep. 2008/36\n\n\n\n1.
