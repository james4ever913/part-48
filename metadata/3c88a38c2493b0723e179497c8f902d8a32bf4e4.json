But you've never seen gold mining like this before Ã¢â‚¬â€ here, the precious metal isn't found in the ground. It's sitting in the most unlikely of places: the bottom of the frigid, unpredictable Bering Sea. And there are a handful of people willing to risk it all to bring it to the surface.\n\nFor two million years, glaciers have been melting into the Bering Sea and depositing sediments rich with gold into its waters. As Nome's ice pack melts during the summer, the isolated, ramshackle town of eccentrics and outcasts booms with excitement as pioneer gold seekers rush to get out onto the water. Miners dive and dredge to scour the bottom of the sea from custom built, barely seaworthy rigs Ã¢â‚¬â€ in a race to haul in as much gold as possible before the waters become too frigid to dive.\n\nBering Sea Gold illustrates a world like none seen before Ã¢â‚¬â€ one where the danger is palpable and the stakes are high. Success in the waters will give the dredgers the hope and means to continue Ã¢â‚¬â€ and maybe even make them rich. Failure could yield a vast array of consequences Ã¢â‚¬â€ from possible jail time to injury and even death.\n\n\nSteve Pomrenke\nShawn Pomrenke\nCody Moen\nEzekial 'Zeke' Tenhoff\nEmily Riedel\nVernon Adkison\nScott Meisterheim\nJason Walker\nSteve Riedel\nHank Schimschat\nGlen LeBaron\nBrad Kelly\nKris Kelly\nAndrew Kelly\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2182427/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt2182427/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c88a38c2493b0723e179497c8f902d8a32bf4e4","amp;dn":"Bering+Sea+Gold+Season+1-3+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c88a38c2493b0723e179497c8f902d8a32bf4e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,136,163,140,36,147,176,114,62,23,148,151,200,249,2,216,163,43,244,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
