It starts as mid-level drug dealer, D&amp;#039;Angelo Barksdale beats a murder rap. After a conversation with a judge, Det. James McNulty has been assigned to lead a joint homicide and narcotics team, in order to bring down drug kingpin Avon Barksdale. Avon Barksdale, accompanied by his right-hand man Stringer Bell, enforcer Wee-Bey and many lieutenants (including his own nephew, D&amp;#039;Angelo Barksdale), has to deal with law enforcement, informants in his own camp, and competition with a local rival, Omar, who&amp;#039;s been robbing Barksdale&amp;#039;s dealers and reselling the drugs. The supervisor of the investigation, Lt. Cedric Daniels, has to deal with his own problems, such as a corrupt bureaucracy, some of his detectives beating suspects, hard-headed but determined Det. McNulty, and a blackmailing deputy. The show depicts the lives of every part of the drug &quot;food chain&quot;, from junkies to dealers, and from cops to politicians.\n\n[url]http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0306414/[/url]\n\n[url]http://www.tv.com/the-wire/show/8800/summary.html?q=the%20wire&amp;tag=search_results;title;0[/url]\n\nSeason 1:\n\n[img]http://img502.imageshack.us/img502/6249/thewires01e01jn4.jpg[/img]\n\nSeason 2:\n\n[img]http://img232.imageshack.us/img232/5678/thewires02e01ko6.jpg[/img]\n\nSeason 3:\n\n[img]http://img232.imageshack.us/img232/5406/thewires03e01yd6.jpg[/img]\n\nSeason 4:\n\n[img]http://img232.imageshack.us/img232/4566/thewires04e01kh8.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://img156.imageshack.us/img156/7417/seedap2.gif[/img]\n\n[b]My Torrents: [/b] \n \n\n \n[b]THE WEST WING - COMPLETE - (BIFTIES): [/b] \n \n\n \n[b]PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN - TRILOGY - (BIFTIES): [/b] \n \n\n \n[b]THE WIRE - SEASON 1 TO SEASON 4 - (BIFTIES): [/b] \n \n \n[b]ULTIMATE FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIP - COLLECTION - UFC 01 to UFC 05 - (BIFTIES):[/b]\n \n \n[b]ULTIMATE FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIP - COLLECTION - UFC 06 to UFC 10 - (BIFTIES):[/b]\n \n \n[b]ULTIMATE FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIP - COLLECTION - UFC 11 to UFC 15 - (BIFTIES):[/b]\n \n \n[b]ULTIMATE FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIP - COLLECTION - UFC 16 to UFC 20 - (BIFTIES):[/b]\n \n \n[b]ULTIMATE FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIP - COLLECTION - UFC 21 to UFC 25 - (BIFTIES):[/b]\n \n \n[b]ULTIMATE FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIP - COLLECTION - UFC 26 to UFC 30 - (BIFTIES):[/b]\n \n\n[b]ULTIMATE FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIP - COLLECTION - UFC 31 to UFC 35 - (BIFTIES):[/b]\n\n\n[b]ULTIMATE FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIP - COLLECTION - UFC 36 to UFC 40 - (BIFTIES):[/b]\n\n\n[b]ULTIMATE FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIP - COLLECTION - UFC 41 to UFC 45 - (BIFTIES):[/b]\n\n \n \n[img]http://img156.imageshack.us/img156/7417/seedap2.gif[/img]\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8703d60c08cf24ede39e030e8ed042b5d70f36b0","amp;dn":"THE+WIRE+-+SEASON+1+TO+SEASON+4+-+%28BIFTIES%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8703d60c08cf24ede39e030e8ed042b5d70f36b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,3,214,12,8,207,36,237,227,158,3,14,142,208,66,181,215,15,54,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
