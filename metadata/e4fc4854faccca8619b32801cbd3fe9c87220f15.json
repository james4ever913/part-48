Lofty comparisons both, but Hot Rod Circuit deserves to be considered alongside only the best of '90s rockers. After a slight two-song lull, the heartsick &quot;Remover&quot; confirms that this pseudo-debut from relocated Alabama natives Andy Jackson (guitars/vocals), Casey Prestwood (guitars), Jay Russel (bass), and drummer Wes Cross is of rare significance. Combining reckless guitars and oblique but emotive vocals into a giant primitive racket, Hot Rod Circuit's initial offering is nearly unmatched in its time with the possible exception of touring mates At the Drive-In's Relationship of Command. More than second-wave emocore, If I Knew Now What I Knew Then is one of just a handful of late-'90s discs that even aspired to breathe life into guitar rock. \n\n\nAudio CD\n\nReleased: Sept 21, 1999\n\nGenre: Rock\n\nStyle: Indie Rock\n\nLabel: Triple Crown Records\n\nQuality: FLAC\n\nAllmusic rating: 3.5 / 5 stars\n\nTracks:\n\n1 Weak Warm\n2 Irish Car Bomb\n3 Slacker\n4 Remover\n5 Chemistry\n6 Medicated Lungs\n7 Achy Breaky Hockey Hair\n8 Good Intentions\n9 Chinese Cuts\n10 Low","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4fc4854faccca8619b32801cbd3fe9c87220f15","amp;dn":"Hot+Rod+Circuit+-+If+I+Knew+Now+What+I+Knew+Then+%281999%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4fc4854faccca8619b32801cbd3fe9c87220f15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,252,72,84,250,204,202,134,25,179,40,1,203,211,254,156,135,34,15,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
