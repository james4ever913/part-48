This is ABSOLUTELY SILENT, no audio is included (except at the beginning). Some of you technical boffins can do a better jo of attaching music to the file than I could, or you can just play something simultaneously.\n\n\nRuan Lingyu had brief but eventful career. Her films usually deal with the cruel treatment of women in Chinese society; she fell victim to this, and killed herself at a young age. This film is based on a traditional story about unrequited love.\n\nThe badly framed picture is only an irritation when intertitles appear on screen; otherwise, it's no worse than pan-and-scan movies.\n\nAnotherreseed in flv format. Stupid TPB makes me label this video-other because of the small file size.\n\nI seeded this b4, bt the torrent died. Please reseed generously.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a13873be3d650ab0875d1130518f7dc9744581af","amp;dn":"Peach+Blossom+Weeps+Tears+of+Blood+%281932%29+%E6%A1%83%E8%8A%B1%E6%B3%A3%E8%A1%80%E8%A8%98","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a13873be3d650ab0875d1130518f7dc9744581af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,56,115,190,61,101,10,176,135,93,17,48,81,143,125,201,116,69,129,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
