Produced in conjunction with the man who started the London based label, RibÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s, Unity Sounds specialised in the mid eighties birth of Dancehall, not the gun toting Hip-Hop influenced Dancehall of modern Jamaica, but sublime digital Reggae that has been hugely influential on artists like Rocker Hi-Fi and Rhythm &amp; Sound, whose Moritz Von Oswald has remastered this material.\n\nSelah Collins ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œPick A SoundÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ begins proceedings with its &quot;version&quot; following (as are most cuts on the album). Check the bass on Kenny Knots ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWatch How The People DancingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, its deep rhythm is stunningly hypnotic, elsewhere ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œReady For The Dancehall TonightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from the fabulously named Peter Bouncer is even better, with a timeless quality and tidy vocal melody.\n\nOther highlights include Mikey MurkaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBack Your AutomaticÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and another Kenny Knots slice of brilliance, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRing My NumberÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Add to this excellent music liner notes that take the length of the album to read, making the listening experience also an invaluable history lesson, especially when most of material included is obscure and certainly unavailable anywhere else. \n\n'Watch How The People Dancing' is a truly essential release for any Reggae fan - the music inspirational and surprising, and unlike many Reggae re-issue labels, it is not a rehash of classic material released too many times on too many formats. Honest JonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s obviously love the music they release and you, the reggae fan, undoubtedly will too. Recommended. ~warprecords.com\n\nTracklist:\n1. Selah Collins - Pick A Sound\n2.

ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨Presented as a next-generation companion to London Is The Place For Me: the mood is more defiant ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a Jamaican secession from London ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ with themes of inner-city sufferation running alongside hymns to the dancehall and the herb superb. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨'ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a whole heap of stuff that we did at that time, different even to the music, that we didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t really know what we were doing, we just done it. This feeling on the records, we did that with everything we did, it was just the vibes that we were carrying then, it was all about one massive vibes. Even with the sound, we werenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t going to choose something that somebody else did, we definitely was going to choose something that somebody else didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t use. We wanted to go out there and say, Yeah, this is the wickedest thing, everyone has to know, and nobody else canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t tell we no different. We pushed it that way, we carried on that way.' \n\n\n\nMarvellous BoyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨Calypso From West AfricaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨HONEST JON'S RECORDS\n\n\nAn incredible collection from Honest Jons -- and like some of the rest of their best, music we never would have heard otherwise! The focus here is on calypso music, but recorded in West Africa -- not the usual Caribbean setting -- a very unusual strain of styles that cropped up in the fading colonial years of the British Empire -- as rhythms were routed southward to Africa, via Caribbean migration to the London scene -- making for some really fresh sounds in the end! The work is often much heavier on percussion than its more familiar variant -- and other instrumentation includes some great horn parts, and bits of guitar -- alongside vocals on most numbers. As usual, the notes are historically helpful and very well done -- and titles include &quot;Scrubbs Na Marvellous Boy&quot; and &quot;Poor Freetown Boy&quot; by Famous Scrubbs, &quot;Olubunmi&quot; by Roy Chicago, &quot;Ariwo&quot; by Chris Ajilo &amp; His Cubanos, &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; and &quot;Gentlemen Bobby&quot; by Bobby Benson &amp; His Combo, &quot;Mami&quot; by The Rhythm Aces, &quot;Arria Baby&quot; and &quot;Fire Fire Fire&quot; by Ebenezer Calender &amp; His Maringer Band, &quot;Tree &amp; The Monkey&quot; by ET Mensah, and &quot;Yabomisa Sawale&quot; by Victor Olaiya.

Honest Jon's have added to the highest order of this simple music of heartbreaking celebration' (Brainwashed). ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨The inter-war dance bands of British West Africa are often strikingly similar in sound to Trinidadian orchestras like Lovey's String Band (credited with the first calypso recordings, in 1912). However, the first West African calypso recordings in the modern style are from Freetown, Sierra Leone in the early 1950s, by Ebenezer Calendar and Famous Scrubbs. In arrangements blending African and European instruments, the brass plays out the legacy of colonial military bands, albeit hair-down and a little ramshackle now; and the beautiful creole lyrics are as upful, quick, current, musical and intimate as any classic calypsonian's. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨Decca also organized the first calypso recording session in Ghana, down the coast, where a sound interchangeably designated 'calypso' or 'highlife' ruled urban dancefloors, courtesy of The Tempos ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ fronted here by Julie Okine ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and its spin-offs The Black Beats, The Red Spots, and finally The Rhythm Aces. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨The invasion of King Mensah of Ghana, and The Tempos' money-spinning tour of Nigeria at the start of the 1950s sparked a decade of musical innovation. Bobby BensonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s new highlife eleven-piece included the great trumpeters Victor Olaiya and Roy Chicago ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ both leaving to lead the bands featured here, the Cool Cats and Rhythm Dandies ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and his calypso Taxi Driver was their first, huge, signature hit. (By contrast, little is known about the Nigerian Rolling Stone, whose real name was Roland Onaghise, singing here in the Bini dialect with such rootical frankness.) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨The Mayor's Dance Band was the second lineup run by the celebrated Erekosima 'Rex' Lawson, after the Nigeraphone Studio Orchestra Of Onitsha, and highly successful throughout the 1960s. With Lawson's trademark blend of Igbo lyrics over a Calabari rhythm, reflecting his mixed parentage, and his superb, Caribbean-flavoured trumpet-playing, Bere Bote is the latest of the recordings here. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨Like Lawson, Steven Amechi was from eastern Nigeria ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the guitar solo on Nylon Dress is by the king of Igbo highlife, Stephen Osita Osadebe. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨The Tempos' drummer Guy Warren once recalled a trip to London, where he'd played in Kenny Graham's pioneering Afro Cubists: 'When I was in London I went to the Caribbean Club somewhere near Piccadilly, the haunt of a lot of West Indians. It was all calypso every night... When I came back I brought some of these records and we learnt to play them as I knew straightaway that these musical inflections were so highlifish.' And most likely he would have thrown in some of Ambrose Campbell's London recordings of calypso highlife with the West African Rhythm Brothers, including horn players from the Caribbean ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ at that time making an epochal impact back home in Nigeria. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨And saxophonist Chris Ajilo was likewise deeply impressed by the Afro Cubists, forming his band The Cubanos on his return to Lagos in 1955, after studying at the London School Of Music. (Baba Ani, aka Lekan Animashaun ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ stalwart of Fela Kuti's music, from the Koola Lobitos to Egypt 80 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ was in later lineups.) A tribal 'woro', 'fire dance', from Egun country, obviously Ariwo isn't highlife-calypso, it's cooking afro-cuban jazz with traditional roots; but it exemplifies the open hybridity of all these forms, and the receptivity of their West African milieu to inspiration abroad, as throughout the 1950s West African musicians like King Bruce of The Rhythm Aces, the Sierra Leonean calypsonian Ali Ganda, E.T. Mensah and Zeal Onyia all checked out London's burgeoning West Indian and West African scenes. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¨By the early 1960s, calypso was fading in West Africa. US soul and rhythm and blues were poised to replace Caribbean influences, even as there was also a turn towards more traditional, local, African musical material. Still, the dying embers would produce its most classical exponent, Godwin Omabuwa, Nigeria's own Lord Kitchener, ebulliently singing here about a famous victory of the middleweight Dick Tiger. Another graduate of Bobby Benson's orchestras, his band the Casanova Dandies at this time included the jazz modernist Mike Falana, on the eve of his departure for London, where he would join Peter King's African Jazz Messengers. In the face of changing tastes, Omabuwa cut only a few records, and his live audience was steeply reduced to prostitutes and their customers in a Lagos Island dive, but his mastery of the genre was a fitting end to the heyday of calypso in British West Africa. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5010510/Give_Me_Love__amp__Sprigs_of_Time_[Honet_Jon_s]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5010510/Give_Me_Love__amp__Sprigs_of_Time_[Honet_Jon_s]&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ec9ec761e9e74daa60c4064a8df0cefa53335c8","amp;dn":"Watch+How+the+People+Dancing+%26+Marvellous+Boy+%5BHonest+Jon%5C%27s%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ec9ec761e9e74daa60c4064a8df0cefa53335c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,201,236,118,30,158,116,218,166,12,64,100,168,223,12,239,165,51,53,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
