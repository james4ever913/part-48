This visual feast is famous for director Julie Taymor&amp;#039;s complex animal-puppet-human fusion. The musical tells the Hamlet-like tale of Simba, prince of African lions, who battles his evil Uncle Scar for the throne after Scar kills Simba&amp;#039;s father, and blames the murder on Simba. But before Simba is able to take his rightful place in the &quot;Circle of Life&quot; he grows up with two fun-loving friends, wisecracking meerkat Timon and smelly warthog Pumbaa, who teach him their philosophy of life -- &quot;Hakuna Matata&quot; (No Worries). The score includes the Oscar-winning song, &quot;Can You Feel the Love Tonight.&quot; Suitable for all ages.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3fa02be055016992860fb661b1d430c85798fe4","amp;dn":"The+Lion+King","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3fa02be055016992860fb661b1d430c85798fe4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,250,2,190,5,80,22,153,40,96,251,102,27,29,67,12,133,121,143,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
