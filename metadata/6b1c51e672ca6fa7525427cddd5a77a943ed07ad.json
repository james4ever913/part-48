Martyr with a &quot;finished ending&quot;. This isn't the usual shit you've probably heard either; where the song was just spliced together twice. This is a REAL extended version!\n\n     I'm pretty sure I saved this song with the right settings after editing, but if for any reason this torrent does not work just post a comment and I will do my best to figure it out.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n\n\nWell... it has been one day since uploading this and the torrent file on my comp was lost due to a system crash! I created it again and started seeding so someone let me know if it is downloadable or not or if it is woking after downloading.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b1c51e672ca6fa7525427cddd5a77a943ed07ad","amp;dn":"Soilwork+-+Martyr+%28REAL+extended+version","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b1c51e672ca6fa7525427cddd5a77a943ed07ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,28,81,230,114,202,111,167,82,84,39,205,221,90,119,169,67,237,7,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
