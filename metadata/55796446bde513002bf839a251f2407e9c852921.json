Edgar Winchester Ã‚Â© 2007\n\nAges 10 and up\nEpic Fantasy Fiction - American Gothic Literature - Southern Literature\n \n\nHidden somewhere deep within the dense forests of the Smoky Mountains lies a fantastic secret, a secret that will change the way we see our world forever...The rift is real!\n\nHigh IQ twelve year old ELIJAH WEBB never thought he'd witness a miracle, or hear angels singing. He never imagined he'd soar above the clouds in an invisible airship, or eat food made from plaid food cubes. He never dreamed he'd visit enchanted subterranean worlds, or befriend troll princes. All he has ever known is how much his mother has suffered since the disappearance of his scientist father over ten years ago, and how, much to his chagrin, she's turned to God for comfort; He himself never wanted God. The problem is God, the great and mysterious source of all things, above ground and below, both mundane and magic, wants him! And when that happens... there's no place to run!\n\n&quot;The Webb Pages saga is ingenious, entertaining, and thought provoking!&quot; - Sarah H.
