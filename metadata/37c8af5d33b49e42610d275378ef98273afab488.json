HBO has shown no inclination to make this commercially available - which is pity, since the only other copy I've seen was a horrid version on YouTube. The source is a DVD sent to Emmy voters For Consideration. &quot;For Your Consideration&quot; pops up several times during the 90-minute film, but it's not that much of a distraction.
