Medieval Islamic scholars helped turn the magical and occult practice of alchemy into modern chemistry. And physicist Ibn al-Haytham helped establish the modern science of optics. Jameel Al-Khalili argues that these scholars are among the first to insist that all scientific theories are backed up by careful experimental observation, bringing a rigour to science that didn't exist before.\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 59mn 3s 9ms\n\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\nLanguage          : English UK\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Documentary\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 967 Kbps\nAspect            : 512 x 384 (1.333) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 121 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8990f44e31de5f21f4e6ca4d5f2a0a08fd9129eb","amp;dn":"BBC-Science+and+Islam+%282009%29+2of3.PDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8990f44e31de5f21f4e6ca4d5f2a0a08fd9129eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,144,244,78,49,222,95,33,244,230,202,77,95,42,10,8,253,145,41,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
