Shortly after television anchorman-turned-U.S. congressman Evan Baxter (Carell) relocates his family from Buffalo to Northern Virginia, God (Morgan Freeman) reveals to him that a devastating flood is coming and the planet is about to be cleansed once again. Later, when Baxter accepts the responsibility of building a great ark and his rapidly changing physical appearance begins to draw media attention, his skeptical family attempts to discern if his actions are driven by delusion or divine intervention. John Goodman, Wanda Sykes, Jonah Hill, and Molly Shannon co-star in a divine comedy of truly epic proportions. \n\nRipped with Handbrake.\n\nLength: 1 Hour 36 Minutes\n\nFile Type: MP4","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad7b14b50ba902929c0aa10588c292054ae2a814","amp;dn":"Evan+Almighty%282007%29DVDRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad7b14b50ba902929c0aa10588c292054ae2a814","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,123,20,181,11,169,2,146,156,10,161,5,136,194,146,5,74,226,168,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
