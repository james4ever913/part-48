These are the Turbo CD Games It Came from the Desert, Lords of the Rising Sun, Fighting Street (Street Fighter, for those in the know), Shape Shifter, and the Gates of Thunder 3-in-1 disc.\n\nThese are in Nero format.  Don&amp;#039;t bother burning these, you won&amp;#039;t get sound that way.  Just mount the images using Nero tools, and play in emulator of choice.  Quizzically, if burned they WILL work in the X-Box TG emulator.\n\nI am sorry for slow transfer and seeding, I will seed as much as I possibly can.  These games are rare indeed and I don&amp;#039;t wish to see them lost (Not even Cinemaware themselves have a copy of Lords of the Rising Sun on TG)\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4ce767b77f1ef12b0087f3e0b54666956832d41","amp;dn":"Collection+of+Turbo+CD+Games","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4ce767b77f1ef12b0087f3e0b54666956832d41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,206,118,123,119,241,239,18,176,8,127,62,11,84,102,105,86,131,45,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
