In the wilds of the forest, while investigating the mass slaughter of an innocent family, the king's forester comes face-to-face with a monstrous beast found only in folk tales and nightmares.\n\n&quot;Meanwhile, travelling the same road, a scholarly young priest begins his education in the nature of the evil that festers just beneath the surface of a seemingly peaceful realm. For the royal family is facing a betrayal that only sorcery can accomplish. And now, for three beautiful sisters, for a young man elevated to knighthood, and for for countless others, a darkness is emerging to shatter all that once seemed certain, familiar, and good.\n\n&quot;Numerous separate destinies will become entangled as malevolent forces stalk the land -- and the Briar King, that primeval harbinger of death, has awakened from his slumber.&quot;\n\n\n\nYou can also read an awesome review of the entire series here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://afantasyreader.blogspot.co.nz/2009/07/kingdoms-of-thorn-and-bone-review.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://afantasyreader.blogspot.co.nz/2009/07/kingdoms-of-thorn-and-bone-review.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\n-Ventricle","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4ec1369f1107d47c9f5bb6bbc27180800c295ff","amp;dn":"The+Kingdoms+of+Thorn+and+Bone+Series+by+Greg+Keyes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4ec1369f1107d47c9f5bb6bbc27180800c295ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,236,19,105,241,16,125,71,201,245,187,107,188,39,24,8,0,194,149,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
