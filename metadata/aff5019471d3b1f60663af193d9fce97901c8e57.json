It examines the interaction between zonal and integrated management approaches and the conservation of marine living resources and marine biological diversity. The study examines the limitations of the traditional zonal approach and suggests new possibilities for conformity between sovereign states, international law and sustainable development.\n\n\n\nHardcover: 310 pages\nPublisher: Ashgate Publishing Company (December 31, 2008)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0754671704\nISBN-13: 978-0754671701\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Approach-Governance-Ashgate-International-Series/dp/0754671704/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Approach-Governance-Ashgate-International-Series/dp/0754671704/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nTags: UN, UNSC, UNCLOS, USA, Japan, PRC, Phillipines, Singapore, Indonesia, Russia, ASEAN, DPRK, ROK, Vietnam, International, Law, Relations, relation, International Relations, Politics, Political, Science, legality, law, sea, Pacific, Diaoyu, Spratly, flashpoint, war, conflict, Paracel, Ww2, maritime, Pivot, balance, rebalance, confidence building, diplomacy, conflict studies, security studies, 2012, 2013, PLAN, PLAAF, JSDF, JMSDF, USN, USMC, USAF, Air, Sea, Air Sea, Okinawa, littoral, 9 dash, 9 dotted","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aff5019471d3b1f60663af193d9fce97901c8e57","amp;dn":"A+Dual+Approach+to+Ocean+Governance+%5Bblackatk%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aff5019471d3b1f60663af193d9fce97901c8e57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,245,1,148,113,211,177,246,6,99,175,25,61,159,206,151,144,28,142,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
