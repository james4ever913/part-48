David Gibson's unique approach to mixing gives you a visual representation of the dynamics of the sounds involved in creating a musical mix. Through this three-dimensional, colorful explanation, you are introduced to a framework that will help you understand everything that an engineer does-- enabling you to not only recognize what you like, but how to achieve it in your studio. Expand your recording techniques by learning what your recording equipment does and how it all works together in a simple, visual manner. From bluegrass to big band, new age to heavy metal, classical to hip-hop, jazz to rap, and alternative rock to techno, Gibson has mapped out everything that can be done to create various effects in all standard mixes. Once you have a perspective on what can be done, you have the power to be truly creative on your own: to make art out of technology.\n\nPaperback: 344 pages\nPublisher: Cengage Learning; 2 edition (March 28, 2005)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1931140456\nISBN-13: 978-1931140454","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:720a6858c22049e2c353ecffb6efedf3c1d537ee","amp;dn":"A+Visual+Guide+to+Recording%2C+Engineering%2C+and+Production","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"720a6858c22049e2c353ecffb6efedf3c1d537ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,10,104,88,194,32,73,226,195,83,236,255,182,239,237,243,193,213,55,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
