The melting of the permafrost has led to the warming of the climate, and we'll continue to see extreme weather and heat waves in parts of the US and S. Asia/India, he offered. \n\nVarious astrological aspects are occurring this summer which could lead to major seismic events that could be political as well as physical, he noted. A number of huge earthquakes in the past have occurred when Uranus is influencing other planets, and we could see major shaking in such places as Southern California, he warned. He foresees a quiet hurricane season, except for one huge storm that could rival Hurricane Andrew, and possibly land in the Gulf Coast. \n\nHis other predictions included an economic crisis in October, a diplomatic breakthrough for the US and Iran, and midterm elections that will likely keep the same balance of Democrats and Republicans. He also talked about Nostradamus' reference to &quot;Mabus&quot; as the third Antichrist, and various interpretations of the quatrain that mentions this. Interestingly, Nostradamus did not single out the year 2012 for anything noteworthy, Hogue added. \n\nWitchcraft Update\nFirst hour guest, witchcraft expert Fiona Horne discussed spells and meditations she uses in her daily practice. &quot;You can tap into an innate sense of empowerment within yourself,&quot; she said, adding that there's also an inherent power in objects and things of the natural world which can be used create positive change. \n\n\nWebsite(s):\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢hogueprophecy.com\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢fionahorne.com\nBook(s):\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Predictions for 2010\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Nostradamus and the Antichrist: Code Named MABUS\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Witch: A Magickal Journey\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢7 Days to a Magickal New You\nCD(s):\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢Magikal Life","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2320320e5802ab466d8724fa27a26d7544a3b1e7","amp;dn":"Coast+to+Coast+AM+-+06-16-10+-+2010+Prophecies+%26+Nostradamus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2320320e5802ab466d8724fa27a26d7544a3b1e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,32,50,14,88,2,171,70,109,135,36,250,39,162,109,117,68,163,177,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
