In a stunning indictment of sweeping policy changes during the Bush years, author Naomi Wolf (The Beauty Myth) makes a chilling case that American democracy is under threat.\n\nInvestigating parallels between our current situation and the rise of dictators and fascism in once-free societies, Wolf uncovers a number of deeply unsettling similaritiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½from the use of paramilitary groups and secret prisons to the targeted suspension of the rule of law. With this galvanizing call to arms based on her recent book, she urges regular citizens to take back our legacy of\nfreedom and justice.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aed1e9e02906e7971e614c4e960a7d04adc63a1b","amp;dn":"The+End+of+America+2008+DVDRip+XviD-DOMiNO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aed1e9e02906e7971e614c4e960a7d04adc63a1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,209,233,224,41,6,231,151,30,97,76,78,150,10,125,4,173,198,58,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
