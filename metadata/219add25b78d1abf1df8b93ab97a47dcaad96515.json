THANKS.\n\n--\n\n10 Episodes in total featuring: BUTT-O-WEEN: 'Tis the season for terrorizing your neighbors. And these classic Beavis and Butt-Head episodes have tricks and treats so sweet you'll get a stomachache. The hapless mischief-makers dress up for Halloween, hang out with a psychopathic murderer, screw up lame pranks, and go door to door selling candy. So, smash that pumpkin and turn off the lights. Beavis and Butt-Head are about to make you scream -- with laughter. BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO CHRISTMAS: 'Tis the season to be cool, as Beavis and Butt-Head star in their own twisted versions of two holiday classics. The ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future struggle to teach a scrooge-like Beavis the true meaning of Christmas, while Charlie the Angel comes down from heaven to show Butt-Head how much better life would be without him. Will Beavis and Butt-Head learn their lesson? Does a snowflake have a chance in hell?\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Beavis-Butt-head-Christmas-Butt-Ween/dp/B0006OGDCY/ref=pd_cp_d_1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Beavis-Butt-head-Christmas-Butt-Ween/dp/B0006OGDCY/ref=pd_cp_d_1&lt;/a&gt;\n\n--\n\nNote:  To watch this movie on your PC, you'll need to download and install a virtual DVD drive. I recommend Virtual Clone Drive, by Slysoft.  I also use CloneDVD to burn, but most other DVD burning programs will probably do the job.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:219add25b78d1abf1df8b93ab97a47dcaad96515","amp;dn":"Butt-O-Ween+-+Beavis+and+Butthead+Do+Christmas.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"219add25b78d1abf1df8b93ab97a47dcaad96515","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,154,221,37,183,141,26,191,29,248,185,58,185,122,71,220,170,217,101,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
