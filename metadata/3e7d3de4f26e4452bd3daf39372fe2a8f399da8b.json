There has not been a record this savage since The Sonics and The Stooges.\n\n&quot;\nFreaks With The Savage Beat&quot; is OUT NOW on Golly Gee Records.\n\nThis release is going to really turn some heads (and ruin some ears!). It's really refreshing to hear something like this being put out by a new young band. These guys take the late '50s &quot;Desperate Rock'n'Roll&quot; (rockabilly AND R&amp;B) influences and turn 'em inside out, exposing rock'n'roll's stinking, rotting guts. And, just in case you don't think\nthat's sick enough for ya, they then fuck it up even more by throwing in dashes of Sonics, Screamin' Jay Hawkins, Gories, Oblivians, Mummies, Back From the Grave, and Los Marauders, resulting in some of the most authentic primitive rock'n'roll I've heard in years. These cats could be the Cramps (or maybe at least the Raunch Hands) of the new millennium!!\nGet this thing out PRONTO so it can be my #1 pick of the year.&quot;\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e7d3de4f26e4452bd3daf39372fe2a8f399da8b","amp;dn":"The+Hexxers-Garage%2FPunk%2FRockabilly","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e7d3de4f26e4452bd3daf39372fe2a8f399da8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,125,61,228,242,110,68,82,189,61,175,57,55,47,226,168,243,153,218,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
