Balian, (Orlando Bloom), a peasant blacksmith in France is visited by Godfrey of Ibelin (Liam Neeson). Godfrey reveals to Balian that he is his father, and he asks Balian to come with him and fight in the Crusades. Balian tells his father that he is mourning his wife, who has just committed suicide after the death of their newborn.\n\nThe village priest callously informs Balian that his late wife burns in hell for her actions, and enrages the grieving blacksmith to the point where he attacks and murders the holy man. Fleeing his native village, he joins up with Godrey and heads off to the Crusades. Before dying, Godfrey knights his bastard Son, and makes him Baron of Ibelin, a territory in the Holy Land.
