As the 2007/2008 Blackhawks team makes its push for the 2008 playoffs, its fans now have another great sports anthem, courtesy of Al and his co-conspirators in Ministry. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKeys To The City,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a rock anthem sure to inspire Blackhawks fans worldwide, will debut on March 5, 2008. As part of the debut, 200 lucky fans of Ministry and the Blackhawks will win tickets to see the March 5 game.\n\nBorn in Cuba and having immigrated to the U.S. at the age of two, Jourgensen was raised in Colorado and Chicago, settling in the Windy City in the late 1970s. As a youth, Al would attend Chicago Blackhawks Hockey games watching from the upper balcony at the old Chicago Stadium. After founding the industrial metal rock band in 1980, and as the band gained popularity, Al graduated to season tickets in the main bowl. Living now in El Paso, TX, Al still gets back to Chicago from time to time to watch his beloved Blackhawks and is a worldwide evangelist for the team, often sporting his Blackhawks jersey on tour.\n\nLast fall, as the buzz began to build around the new, young Blackhawks team, Jourgensen decided he wanted to add to the momentum. In his studios rehearsing for their farewell tour, Al picked up on a guitar riff that hadnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t made his final album and started building what would become ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKeys to the City,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a sports rock anthem that he presented as a gift to the Wirtz family and the Chicago Blackhawks in December of 2007. The Blackhawks have since embraced the song as a great opportunity to reach out to a new generation of Blackhawks fans; a worthy companion to the teamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s official theme song, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHere Come The Hawks.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n&quot;The Chicago Blackhawks RULE!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ said Al Jourgensen. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI am honored to be a part of the history and legend of one of hockey&amp;#039;s Original Six. I hope ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Keys to The CityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ inspires some awesome fights on the ice.&quot;\n\nKeys to the City\nThough containing trademark intensity and guitar riffs, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKeys to the CityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is less a traditional Ministry song, but more a classic sports anthem in structure. Built around a drum/bass line that recalls Garry GlitterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRock nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Roll Pt 2,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ the song is a rallying cry for Blackhawk fans. Name checking the past Hawk greats like Hull, Mikita, Esposito and Savard, the song celebrates the resurgence of the Blackhawks and the quest to bring home the Stanley Cup to Chicago. It is already popular among the young Blackhawks players upon which the team is building its future championships.\n\nMarch 5 Debut\nAl Jourgensen will travel to Chicago for the March 5 debut of the song. After a day of media interviews supporting the song and MinistryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s farewell tour, which comes to ChicagoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s House of Blues in early May, Jourgensen and his wife will be the guest of the Blackhawks at the game that night and will participate in game festivities. As part of the dayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s promotions, 200 fans of Ministry and the Blackhawks will get free tickets to the televised March 5 home game against the Anaheim Ducks. Details on how to win the tickets will be posted at ChicagoBlackhawks.com. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKeys to the CityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is now available for download on Download on iTunes. Proceeds from the song will benefit the Blackhawks charities.
