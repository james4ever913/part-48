You control your army at the regimental level, so at the most you have to worry about giving orders to ten entities at any point in time. Like Myth: The Fallen Lords, it\\&amp;#039;s a refreshing change of pace from most of the current crop of RTS games. There\\&amp;#039;s no base-base building or unit manufacturing here - you are left entirely free to contemplate the subtleties of the slaughter. If you like Myth: Fallen Lords (and just for the record, I do), Dark Omen is about the closest you can get right now if you\\&amp;#039;re looking for more.&quot;\n\n\nPolnaya russkaya versia, perevod ot &quot;7 volka multimedia&quot; ;)\n\nScreenshots: http://www.ag.ru/gallery/1074\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c165ac8afc5095c7b31b2e0f11bea4749870ff08","amp;dn":"Warhammer%3A+DarkOmen+%5BRUS+%7C+Full+version%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c165ac8afc5095c7b31b2e0f11bea4749870ff08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,101,172,138,252,80,149,199,179,27,46,15,17,190,164,116,152,112,255,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
