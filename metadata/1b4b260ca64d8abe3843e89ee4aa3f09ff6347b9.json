It was also the first western TV series to win an Emmy award. Starring veteran western actor Jim Davis as railroad detective Matt Clark, the series set Clark and his fellow railroad detective partners (Mary Castle as Frankie Adams for the first half of the season and Kristine Miller as &quot;Jonesy&quot; during the second half)against historic western outlaws of various periods ranging from the mid-1860&amp;#039;s to the early 1900&amp;#039;s. The series was very satisfying, easy to watch, and fairly realistic due mainly to the easygoing charm of Jim Davis in the lead role. He seemed like an actual western character. One other note. When Matt Clark would arrive in town after a long ride he actually looked like he had been on a long horse ride as he would be covered in dust.\n\nA very good early adult western. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b4b260ca64d8abe3843e89ee4aa3f09ff6347b9","amp;dn":"%7DLegends+of+the+Old+West+-+Clay+Allison+%2813+of+39%29+%5B1954%5D+%28+Alie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b4b260ca64d8abe3843e89ee4aa3f09ff6347b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,75,38,12,166,77,138,190,56,67,232,158,228,170,63,9,255,99,71,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
