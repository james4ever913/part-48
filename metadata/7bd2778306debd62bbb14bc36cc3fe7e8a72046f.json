Hanging on to long-standing customers and attracting new ones is a constant battle. Supermarkets are employing an arsenal of tactics and strategies. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a free-for-all. So how can a store attract new customers or even keep its loyal base? In Fairfield, Ohio, Jim Bonaminio, offers an experience like none other. The owner of Jungle JimÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s International Market, he offers thousands of products from around the globe, turning a trip to the grocery store into a destination.\n\nIn this war among food giants, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s crucial not to lose ground. Take Loblaws, CanadaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s top supermarket chain. 140,000 employees. Hundreds of new products launched each year. Yet itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been tough for them to stay number one. So the company is fanning out, sending product developers across the globe in a search for the next new flavour that will appeal to Canadians.But even the best efforts of scientists and chefs arenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t always enough. Getting a new product onto your plate is a bit like high stakes poker. In North America, the food industry develops roughly 18,000 new items each year, but nine out of ten donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t even make it to store shelves. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s especially difficult for small players in the industry to get a foot in the door. \n\nSepp Amsler owns Naturally Homegrown Foods Ltd., a company located in Maple Ridge, British Columbia. He has developed Hardbite, an organic kettle-cooked potato chips. But the snack food world has some heavyweights like Frito Lay. So Sepp has to fight for his place in the food chain. There are some Davids out there willing to take on the food industry Goliaths. Liz Neumark is one of them. She owns the catering company Great Performances, which caters some of New YorkÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most upscale soirees. Liz is also a locavore, an activist in the local food movement. Liz offers her clients a menu consisting mainly of products grown within a 160-km radius of New York City.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Battle to get on to your PlateÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ will take you behind of scenes in this high stakes game of intrigue. Every step, every player, every ingredient can mean the difference between success and failure. \n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 349 MiB for 45mn 11s 745ms\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : HDTV\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 956 Kbps\nAspect            : 480 x 272 (1.765) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 111 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bd2778306debd62bbb14bc36cc3fe7e8a72046f","amp;dn":"The+Great+Food+Revolution_2+of+4_CBC+Doc+Zone_HDTV_XviD%7EEkolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bd2778306debd62bbb14bc36cc3fe7e8a72046f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,210,119,131,6,222,189,98,187,177,75,195,108,195,254,126,138,114,4,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
