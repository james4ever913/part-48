He later married Kate Connelly on October 1, 1995, who subsequently divorced him. Mariska Hargitay then set-up Flay on a blind date with actress Stephanie March, her co-star on Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit, in March 2001.[1] The two began dating, and Flay proposed on December 19, 2003, while ice skating at Rockefeller Center.[1] They were married on February 20, 2005,[5] exactly four years after their first date at Nobu restaurant.\n\nAs The New York Times reported, &quot;An early draft of Bar Americain's menu had a beet and goat cheese salad with lentils, but Mr. Flay rejected it before the restaurant opened. 'When I go on vacation, they run specials on lentils,' he said.&quot;[6] In 2007, Flay stated that he had &quot;made peace&quot; with lentils.[7] Flay also dislikes fiddlehead ferns, stating that they &quot;taste like grass.&quot;[8]\n\n[edit] Professional life\n\nFlay dropped out of high school at age 17.[9] In an interview for the New York Daily News, Flay said his first jobs in the restaurant industry were with a pizza parlor and Baskin-Robbins.[10] Afterwards Flay took a position making salads at Joe Allen Restaurant in New York's Theatre District, where his father was a partner.[1][11] Joe Allen was impressed by Flay's natural ability and decided to pay his tuition at the French Culinary Institute.[12]\n\nFlay received a degree in culinary arts and was a member of the first graduating class of the French Culinary Institute in 1984. After culinary school, he started working as a sous-chef, quickly learning the culinary arts. Flay was handed the executive chef's position after a week when the executive chef was fired. Flay quit when he realized he was not ready to run a kitchen. He took a position as a chef working for restaurateur Jonathan Waxman at Bud and Jams.[1] Waxman introduced Flay to southwestern cuisine, which came to define his culinary career.[12] Flay said, &quot;Jonathan Waxman was the first person to teach me what good food was.&quot;[1] Flay additionally worked for a short time on the floor at the American Stock Exchange. Flay's first job back as a chef was as the executive chef at Miracle Grill in the East Village, where he worked from 1988 to 1990.[12] This caught the attention of restaurateur Jerome Kretchmer, who was looking for a southwestern style chef. Impressed by Flay's food, Kretchmer offered him the position of executive chef at Mesa Grill, which opened on 15 January 1991.[2] Shortly after, Flay became a partner. In November 1993, Flay partnered with Laurence Kretchmer to open Bolo Bar &amp; Restaurant[2][12] in the Flatiron District, just a few blocks away from Mesa Grill.\nEntrance sign to Mesa Grill in Caesars Palace\n\nFlay opened a second Mesa Grill at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas in 2004,[12] and in 2005 he opened Bar Americain, an American Brasserie, in Midtown Manhattan.[12] He continued to expand his restaurants by opening Bobby Flay Steak in the Borgata Hotel Casino &amp; Spa in Atlantic City, New Jersey. This was followed by a third Mesa Grill in The Bahamas, located in The Cove at Atlantis Paradise Island, which opened on 28 March 2007.\n\nBolo Bar &amp; Restaurant closed its doors on 31 December 2007 to make way for a new condominium.[13]\n\nIn addition to his restaurants and television shows, Flay has been a master instructor and visiting chef at the French Culinary Institute.[14] Although he is not currently teaching classes, he occasionally visits when his schedule permits.[15]\n\nFlay established The Bobby Flay Scholarship in 2003. This full scholarship to the French Culinary Institute is awarded annually to a student in the Long Island City Culinary Arts Program. Flay personally helps select the recipient each year.[16][1]\n\nFlay opened Bobby's Burger Palace in Lake Grove, New York on 15 July 2008. The restaurant is located at the Smith Haven Mall.[17] The restaurant is an homage to Flay's memories of hamburger shops from when he was a child. A second location opened on 5 December 2008 at the Monmouth Mall in Eatontown, New Jersey.[18] A third location is to open in March 2009 in the Bergen Town Center in Paramus, New Jersey.[citation needed]\n\n[edit] Television and film\n\n[edit] Food Network\n\nFlay has hosted seven cooking shows and specials on Food Network, of which five continue to run:\n\n    * Hot Off the Grill with Bobby Flay (no longer airing)\n    * Grillin' &amp; Chillin' (no longer airing)\n    * FoodNation\n    * Boy Meets Grill\n    * BBQ with Bobby Flay\n    * Throwdown! with Bobby Flay\n    * Grill It! with Bobby Flay\n\nFlay served as a judge on The Next Food Network Star and The Next Iron Chef.[19] He has cooked with Emeril Lagasse on his show Emeril Live, and with Paula Deen on her program Paula's Party.\n\n[edit] Iron Chef\n\nFlay is an Iron Chef on the show Iron Chef America.\n\nIn 1997, when the original Iron Chef show traveled to New York for a special battle, he challenged Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto to battle rock crab. After the hour battle ended, Flay stood on top of his cutting board and raised his arms in premature victory. Not realizing that cutting boards and knives are sacred in Japan, he offended Morimoto who criticized his professionalism, saying that Flay was &quot;not a chef&quot;. Flay went on to lose the battle.[20]\n\nFlay challenged Morimoto to a rematch in Morimoto's native Japan. In this battle, at the end of the hour, Flay threw his cutting board on the floor and stood on the counter yet again to raise the roof with the audience. This time, Flay won.[20] Though they share a heated past, Flay and Morimoto, who are both Iron Chefs on Iron Chef America, are now friends.[21] They even teamed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and won ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ against fellow Iron Chefs Mario Batali, Locke Michaels and Hiroyuki Sakai in the Iron Chef America: Battle of the Masters &quot;Tag Team&quot; battle.\n\nOn a special episode of Iron Chef America originally airing on 12 November 2006, Flay and Giada De Laurentiis faced off against, and were defeated by, Rachael Ray and Mario Batali.[22] This was the highest rated show ever broadcast on Food Network.[23]\n\nThe team of Iron Chefs Bobby Flay and Michael Symon defeated the team of Iron Chefs Cat Cora and Masaharu Morimoto in a special episode titled Thanksgiving Showdown which originally aired on 16 November 2008.[24]\n\n[edit] Specials\n\n    * Bobby's Vegas Gamble ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Covers the opening of Mesa Grill Las Vegas.[25]\n    * Restaurant Revamp ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Flay tries to help a family restaurant.[26]\n    * Chefography: Bobby Flay ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Biography of Flay's life and career.[27]\n    * Tasting Ireland ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Flay takes a food tour of Ireland, his ancestral homeland.[28]\n    * Food Network Awards ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The Food Network recognizes people and places that have impacted the food world.[29]\n    * All-Star Grill Fest: South Beach ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Flay joins Paula Deen, Giada De Laurentiis, Alton Brown, and Tyler Florence for a barbecue.[30]\n\n[edit] Other cooking shows\n\nIn 1996, Flay hosted The Main Ingredient with Bobby Flay on Lifetime Television.
