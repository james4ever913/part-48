It is not accessible by wheelchair.\n\nTechnical Details\n\n    * 1 Tuned mass damper\n    * Entrance of observation deck is 6.25 metres (20.5 ft) above ground\n    * 2 lifts for transport of visitors\n    * 1 lift for transport of technical equipment\n    * Steel stairway with 986 steps\n    * Evacuation platforms at 188 metres (594 ft) and 191 metres (627 ft) high\n    * Observation deck at 203.78 (669 ft) metres\n    * Restaurant at 207.53 metres (681 ft)\n    * Height of the tower: 368.03 metres (1207 ft)\n    * Weight of the shaft: 26 000 tonnes\n    * Weight of the sphere 4 800 tonnes\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernsehturm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernsehturm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.berlinerfernsehturm.de/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.berlinerfernsehturm.de/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c38331d3388a7f67f0e98874caa46f4f32645b6d","amp;dn":"Berliner.Fernsehturm.German.XviD.%28DVDRip%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c38331d3388a7f67f0e98874caa46f4f32645b6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,131,49,211,56,138,127,103,240,233,136,116,202,164,111,79,50,100,91,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
