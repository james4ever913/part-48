The song peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming their first significant hit single.\n\n&quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; was written by singer Axl Rose and Slash. (Slash considers it the first song the band ever wrote together.) According to Rose, the inspiration for the lyrics came from an encounter he and a friend had with a man while they were sleeping in a school yard in Queens. When they were approached by the &quot;little black man&quot;,  he yelled at them, &quot;You know where you are? You&amp;#039;re in the jungle baby; you&amp;#039;re gonna die!&quot; This incident inspired the main lyrical declaration for the song. The eponymous line was also featured in the 1984 song &quot;Underwater World&quot; by the Finnish glam punk band Hanoi Rocks, whom Rose has acknowledged as inspiration.\n\nWhile the New York incident inspired the lyrics, the song was written in Seattle, and described Los Angeles. In a 1988 interview with Hit Parader magazine, Rose stated, &quot;I wrote the words in Seattle. It&amp;#039;s a big city, but at the same time it&amp;#039;s still a small city compared to L.A. and the things that you&amp;#039;re gonna learn. It seemed a lot more rural up there. I just wrote how it looked to me. If someone comes to town and they want to find something, they can find whatever they want.&quot; \n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:92f414b18834ac7fc51f21b33a03c311c4c610fa","amp;dn":"Guns+N+Roses+-+Welcome+To+The+Jungle+%28Live+-1988+VMA%5C%27s%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"92f414b18834ac7fc51f21b33a03c311c4c610fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,244,20,177,136,52,172,127,197,31,33,179,58,3,195,17,196,198,16,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
