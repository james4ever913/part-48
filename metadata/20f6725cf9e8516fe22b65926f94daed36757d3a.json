The Prince and Princess of Darkness take two young lovers hostage and subject them to strange, exotic topless burlesque numbers before vanishing at the first light of dawn.  A combination of Z-grade horror movie and girlie tease/strip show flick, featuring such memorable bad dialogue as &quot;no one wishes to see a man dance,&quot; &quot;torture, torture, it pleasures me,&quot; and &quot;a pussycat is born to be whipped.&quot;  May not make sense to those who haven&amp;#039;t seen (or endured) the movie, but the purple and lurid intonations of Criswell and the pathetic comedy attempts of his underlings the Wolfman and the Mummy are good for a laugh.\n\nThis CD features nearly the entire soundtrack of the movie, complete with dialogue and sound effects.  A must have for Ed Wood fans, or people who love cheesy strip music...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20f6725cf9e8516fe22b65926f94daed36757d3a","amp;dn":"Orgy+of+the+Dead+%28Ed+Wood%29+soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20f6725cf9e8516fe22b65926f94daed36757d3a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,246,114,92,249,232,81,111,226,43,101,146,111,148,218,237,54,117,125,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
