The government      \n         calls 9/9/09 the start of the &quot;Modern Plague&quot;,   \n         and the reporter soon realizes that the truth    \n         may be harder to uncover than the lies.          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                          \n                                                            \n                                                          \n                                                            \n                                                          \n                                       \n                               \n                   \n                                                                     \n                                                                       \n     ASPECT &amp; STANDARD  AUDiO \n                                                                     \n         [ ] Fullscreen  4:3        [*] English                        \n         [*] Widescreen 16:9        [ ] Dutch      [ ] DTS 6.1         \n                                     [ ] French     [ ] DS 5.1           \n          [23.976] FPS              [ ] German     [*] DS 2.0          \n          [624x352] Resolution      [ ] Spanish    [ ] DS 2.0 MONO     \n                                    [mp3@128kbps]                      \n                                                                       \n      SUBTiTLES  \n                                                                     \n       [ ] English     [ ] Swedish     [ ] Spanish     [ ] Dutch       \n       [ ] Danish      [ ] German      [ ] Polish      [ ] Italian     \n       [ ] Arabic      [ ] Bulgarian   [ ] Czech       [ ] Greek       \n        [ ] Hindi       [ ] Hungarian   [ ] Croatic     [ ] Romenian     \n       [ ] Slovenia    [ ] Turkish     [ ] Icelandic   [ ] Finnish     \n       [ ] Norwegian   [ ] French      [ ] Hebrew      [ ] Other       \n                                                       [*] None        \n                                                                       \n     ViDEO  MENU  DVD-EXTRAS \n                                                                     \n        [ ] Untouched       [ ] Untouched      [ ] Untouched           \n        [*] Re-encoded      [*] Stripped       [*] Stripped            \n        [2] Passes                             [ ] Partial Stripped    \n        [892] Bitrate                          [ ] Re-encoded          \n                                               [ ] Passes              \n                                                                     \n      Rippers Notes  \n                                                                                  \n       Note: HQ sites needed: see contact info plz!                      \n                                                                       \n                                               \n                                               \n                     \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n         Greetz to everyone helping out the BD WMV and DVDR scene!     \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n     Special greetz to: NOVO INSECTS VOMIT SADPANDA SPiCE SMeG         \n                       Start2 QwiiF XorCist WiiLP NTX XPRESS THUGLiNE  \n                                                                       \n                                                                       \n                     R.I.P.
