I'll be uploading series three and four once I've seeded this torrent.\n\nI should point out that the quality of the original DVDs is fairly average, so don't expect encodes that aren't encodes of something which was fairly average to begin with.\n\nWhat's the difference between these AVIs, which are about 400MB in size (on average), and the older 233MB per episode torrents?\nWell.... season one of the older torrents consists of mpeg files of a fairly low resolution (if memory serves me correctly) so season one in this torrent will definitely be better quality.\nThe rest of the seasons however don't differ much in quality considering the difference in size. Maybe a 5% improvement for an extra 150MB per episode. However these encodes have been cropped differently, so you won't see any black bars or lines of crud down the sides. They're also a higher resolution than the older 233MB encodes (although it doesn't really increase the quality much) and they contain the original 2ch AC3 audio rather than re-encoded MP3 audio. I encoded these to a particular quality, not a particular size, hence the file sizes vary accordingly.\n\nAll episodes are 640x480 and should be playable using any standalone player.\n\nIf you're in a hurry or have limited bandwidth the older 233MB per episode torrents might be more suitable (except for season one) however if bandwidth isn't an issue then these encodes are the better option, if for no other reason than the cropping is nice and clean.\n\nAs my bandwidth is limited and my upload speed is pretty slow, please be patient while I seed, and if you're one of the initial downloaders please stay around for a while and help me out when you're done.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dbb675b02a28aebb6a0bb7cbebca792e20d984a0","amp;dn":"Butterflies+-+Series+1+%26+2+%28Encoded+January+2011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dbb675b02a28aebb6a0bb7cbebca792e20d984a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,182,117,176,42,40,174,187,106,11,183,203,235,202,121,46,32,217,132,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
