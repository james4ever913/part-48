Actually, the vocalist who has spent 16 years playing at Bourbon StreetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Funky Pirate, laughs a lot.\n      \nCarson began his musical journey playing trumpet and then tuba performing in brass bands and in traditional jazz settings. It wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t until a bit later that he found his voice and began singing R&amp;B at New Orleans hotspots. His roots in the tradition remain important to him and heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s always included tunes like ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBasin Street BluesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ in his shows at the Funky Pirate and they often popped up on his previous albums. For his latest project,  however, the vocalist decided to temporarily set aside jazz and gospel flavors and dig into some soul, funk and blues.\n  \nThe CD opens with a suggestion of a second-line rhythm on the uptempo blues number, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCallinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ You OutÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ that has already become a favorite of Funky Pirate patrons. Mark Penton, a guitarist who also plays regularly at the Bourbon Street club, penned this and two other numbers including an album highlight, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Not the End of the World.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ With its strong lyrics and old school soul flavor, it makes a fine vehicle for Carson to do some testifying.\n  \nMuch of the album stylistically draws from the sounds of the 1960s and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢70s including CarsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s single original contribution to the album, the late night, urban blues number ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHip ShakinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Mama.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ In that mode, Carson and the Blues Masters also revamp the legendary Robert JohnsonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ32-20 Blues,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ giving it, what Carson describes as an Ohio Players treatment.\n\nTracklist\n1 I\\\\\\'m Calling You Out \n2 Back to The Old School \n3 Black Cat Bone \n4 Hip Skakin\\\\\\' Mama \n5 School Boy Crush \n6 Don\\\\\\'t Look Any Further \n7 It\\\\\\'s Not the End of the World \n8 The Turning Point \n9 Who Knows \n10 One Really Good Sad Song \n11 I\\\\\\'ll Play The Blues For You \n12 Sunday Funnies \n13 32-20 Blues \n14 A World Without You\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8711e65f92c2c9aa24b354d5736a3075ddf63d6e","amp;dn":"Big+Al+Carson+and++The+Blues+Masters+3+Phat+Catz+And+1+Skinny+Do","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8711e65f92c2c9aa24b354d5736a3075ddf63d6e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,17,230,95,146,194,201,170,36,179,84,213,115,106,48,117,221,246,61,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
