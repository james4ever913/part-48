These programs include ones in your startup folder, Run, RunOnce, and other Registry keys. You can configure Autoruns to show other locations, including Explorer shell extensions, toolbars, browser helper objects, Winlogon notifications, auto-start services, and much more. Autoruns goes way beyond the MSConfig utility bundled with Windows Me and XP.\n\nAutoruns' Hide Signed Microsoft Entries option helps you to zoom in on third-party auto-starting images that have been added to your system and it has support for looking at the auto-starting images configured for other accounts configured on a system. Also included in the download package is a command-line equivalent that can output in CSV format, Autorunsc.\n\nYou'll probably be surprised at how many executables are launched automatically!\n\n\nUsage\n\nSimply run Autoruns and it shows you the currently configured auto-start applications as well as the full list of Registry and file system locations available for auto-start configuration. Autostart locations displayed by Autoruns include logon entries, Explorer add-ons, Internet Explorer add-ons including Browser Helper Objects (BHOs), Appinit DLLs, image hijacks, boot execute images, Winlogon notification DLLs, Windows Services and Winsock Layered Service Providers. Switch tabs to view autostarts from different categories.\n\nTo view the properties of an executable configured to run automatically, select it and use the Properties menu item or toolbar button. If Process Explorer is running and there is an active process executing the selected executable then the Process Explorer menu item in the Entry menu will open the process properties dialog box for the process executing the selected image.\n\nNavigate to the Registry or file system location displayed or the configuration of an auto-start item by selecting the item and using the Jump menu item or toolbar button.\n\nTo disable an auto-start entry uncheck its check box. To delete an auto-start configuration entry use the Delete menu item or toolbar button.\n\nSelect entries in the User menu to view auto-starting images for different user accounts.\n\nMore information on display options and additional information is available in the on-line help.\n\n\nAutorunsc Usage\n\nAutorunsc is the command-line version of Autoruns. Its usage syntax is:\n\nUsage: autorunsc [-a] | [-c] [-b] [-d] [-e] [-g] [-h] [-i] [-l] [-m] [-n] [-p] \n[-r] [-s] [-v] [-w] [-x] [user]\n\n-a\tShow all entries.\n-b\tBoot execute.\n-c\tPrint output as CSV.\n-d\tAppinit DLLs.\n-e\tExplorer addons.\n-g\tSidebar gadgets (Vista and higher).\n-h\tImage hijacks.\n-i\tInternet Explorer addons.\n-l\tLogon startups (this is the default).\n-m\tHide signed Microsoft entries.\n-n\tWinsock protocol and network providers.\n-p\tPrinter monitor drivers.\n-r\tLSA providers.\n-s\tAutostart services and non-disabled drivers.\n-t\tScheduled tasks. \n-v\tVerify digital signatures.\n-w\tWinlogon entries.\n-x  \tPrint output as XML.\nuser\tSpecifies the name of the user account for which autorun items will be shown.\n\n\nChangelog:\n\nAutoruns v9.41: This release fixes a bug with the hide-Microsoft images options when the signature verification option is enabled.\n\nAutoruns v9.4: This Autoruns update shows manual start Windows services, fixes a bug that affected the display of autostart locations that could include multiple startup registrations, and fixes a bug in the Jump To functionality on 64-bit Windows.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0685df1a055cf394f8948c7f5a7af2bed16b369","amp;dn":"Autoruns+9.41","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0685df1a055cf394f8948c7f5a7af2bed16b369","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,104,93,241,160,85,207,57,79,137,72,199,245,167,175,43,237,22,179,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
