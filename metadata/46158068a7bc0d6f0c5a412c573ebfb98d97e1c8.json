Its synopsis in Halliwell's Film Guide simply states &quot;A man, a dog and a duck enjoy bouncing together.\n\nThe plot and the moral are both very simple. The three titular multi-species characters are friends who like to bounce a lot. Bill - the man - suddenly inherits a lot of money and starts spending it with reckless abandon (on, amongst other things, a tin of peaches). He abandons his old friends and becomes increasingly hedonistic.\n\nMeanwhile, the dog and the duck continue bouncing.\n\nEventually, Bill accidentally bounces out of a window in a very tall building. He loses his memory and goes back to his old friends. They set up a business together selling happiness to people.\n\nThe moral of the story is stated to be: &quot;It is easier to sell happiness than to buy it because most people are stupider than you are!&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alf,_Bill_and_Fred&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alf,_Bill_and_Fred&lt;/a&gt;\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis is a short film about a man, a dog and a duck who enjoy bouncing together. A quite charming cartoon, the animation style brings to mind the old Pink Panther cartoons (with little mostachiod men getting angry), but is far more surreal. I especially like the jokes about all the things Bill can buy with lots of money, Alf and Fred's continued bouncing and, of course, the business venture towards the end. Minutes of pure silliness. It's a delight. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057832/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057832/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nRoland Frederick Godfrey (born 27 May 1921) is a distinguished British animator whose career spans more than fifty years. He is probably best known for the children's cartoon series Roobarb (1974), Noah and Nelly in... SkylArk (1977) and Henry's Cat (1983) and for the Trio chocolate biscuit advertisements shown in the UK during the early 1980s. However, he has also produced a BAFTA and Academy award-winning short film Great (1976), a tongue-in-cheek biography of Isambard Kingdom Brunel. \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Godfrey&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n\n.................                                      ..................\n.................*** PLEASE HELP TO SEED IF YOU CAN ***..................\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46158068a7bc0d6f0c5a412c573ebfb98d97e1c8","amp;dn":"ALF%2C+BILL+AND+FRED+-+Bob+Godfrey+animation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46158068a7bc0d6f0c5a412c573ebfb98d97e1c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,21,128,104,167,188,13,111,12,90,65,44,87,62,191,185,141,151,225,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
