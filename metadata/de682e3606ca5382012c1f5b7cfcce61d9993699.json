Hold on! This one starts out really quick and it'll get you moving.  I promise it gets into a real steady house groove sooner than later.  This has got to be my best yet.     \n\nI'd have to admit with the new software I've been using recently making these mixes just got a lot more exciting.  I really played around with this one and pretty much mixed each track individually, played with levels and even through in a few custom mixes.  Though I'm still a rookie I think I'm finally making some progress and getting more comfortable.  Can't wait to play this over the upcoming weekend.\n\nI'd figure the next theme comes as no surprise.  Amazing movie, director, cinematography and soundtrack which really makes for one of the all time greats.  It's one of those movies you could watch in a hundred years and it would probably still relate to society in some way.  Especially now......40 years later.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nn.a.K.\n\nYou can download all of my house mixes on my website at musicthroughscience d0t com\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing \n\n   1.
