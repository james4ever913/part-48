The firmware has been made available for the South Korean market, so the SHV-E210S users can now enjoy the new Android OS, dubbed as KSUKNI3. Since the software is available online, you can anytime download the same in case you want to manually update your Galaxy S3 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exactly what we will be doing during the guidelines from below.\n\nApplying an official firmware manually implies in using a dedicated program. This program will flash the ROM automatically on your Android device, which means that the proper installation process can be completed without problems, even by a newbie who is on his first update experience. Now, in our case, as you might already know, we will be using Odin for manually updating your South Korean Samsung Galaxy S3 to official Android 4.4.4 KitKat KSUKNI3 OS. But, before heading towards the installation instruction, check the lines from below in order to learn how prepare your device for the flashing process that will shortly follow.\n\nThe KSUKNI3 software file which will be flashed on your Galaxy S3 is the same OS as the OTA release. So, you are completing an official operation, without taking any risks. Thus, the warranty of your Galaxy S3 will not get void if you choose to follow this tutorial. Moreover, the steps from below will be compatible with both rooted and locked devices. But, if you have previously root your phone, now the root access will be revoked Ã¢â‚¬â€œ you will reinstall all the factory and default restrictions and programs on your device. So, this guide is perfect if you want to relock your S3, or if you want to fix software related issues such as bugs, lags, force close errors, battery drain and so on.\n\nThe new OS comes with new features and capabilities and with an improved Android interface. Of course, we are talking about the latest version of Android KitKat system, so the new OS will smoothly run on your Samsung Galaxy S3 SHV-E210S. According to the users who have already tested it, the ROM is running without lags or bugs and there arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t any issues related to this new KitKat release.\n\nNow, even though it is unlikely to happen, after completing the steps from this tutorial, your Galaxy S3 might get stuck in a boot loop. In that case you will have to make a hard reset (more info are being detailed during the troubleshoot section of this step by step guide) which means that you can lose your personal data, info and accounts along with everything else thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s saved on the internal storage memory of your S3. Due to same reasons, I recommend you to make a backup before going any further.\n\nBy doing so you will be able to avoid any unpleasant situations and you will also be able to save your contacts, texts, call logs, internet settings, EFS folder, market apps, images, videos, audio files and any other things you might need afterward. In that matter, access Google Play and download compatible backup and restore apps, or cloud service programs.\n\nThen, just before starting the proper update operation, make sure that you can use a Windows powered computer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Odin will work only on the same. Also, ensure that you can use your phone and its USB cable. Next, on your Galaxy S3, from Ã¢â‚¬Å“menu Ã¢â‚¬â€œ setting Ã¢â‚¬â€œ developer optionsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ enable the USB debugging option Ã¢â‚¬â€œ if you want to properly establish a connection between your computer and your smartphone. On your computer there shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be activated any security programs (temporarily deactivate the same) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ do that or else the antivirus like programs might interfere with the flashing operation.\n\nIt is essential to check the battery power that is left on your handset. Why? Well, because it might get turned off in the middle of the installation process and you can end up in bricking your phone. So, if the power left is less than 50%, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hesitate and plug in the charger. Also, complete this step by step guide only if you own the South Korean variant of the Samsung Galaxy S3 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the Android 4.4.4 KitKat KSUKNI3firmware has been OTA released only for the mentioned device, so try not to mess things up.\nHow to Update South Korean Galaxy S3 to Android 4.4.4 Official KitKat KSUKNI3 Firmware\n\n    From here you can download the firmware file.\n    Download Odin and Samsung KIES.\n    Place all the files on your computer.\n    Then, unzip Odin and install the program.\n    Also unzip the update package and place the resulted file on desktop.\n    Install Samsung KIES; use the tool for flashing the Galaxy S3 USB drivers on your computer Ã¢â‚¬â€œ skip this step if the drivers are already installed on your computer.\n    Run Odin on your PC.\n    Turn off your phone and reboot it into download mode: after completely shutting down your device, press power, volume down and home buttons at the same time, for a few seconds.\n    Connect your Galaxy S3 with your computer; use the USB cord in order to establish the mentioned connection.\n    Now, take a look on the program where the Ã¢â‚¬Å“addedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ message should be already displayed; the ID:COM section should also be yellow or blue Ã¢â‚¬â€œ if not, try to reinstall the drivers on your computer and then repeat the steps from above.\n    From Odin you now have to select the Ã¢â‚¬Å“PAÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ option; up next, pick the Android 4.4.4 KitKat OS from desktop.\n    DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make any other changes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ click on Ã¢â‚¬Å“startÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ when you are ready.\n    Wait while your Galaxy S3 is being automatically updated.\n    In the end, reboot your phone and remove the USB cord.\n\nTroubleshoot solutions\n\nIf a boot loop issue is being caused, you need to enter recovery mode on your Android device.
