The group then uncouple the front car from the rest of the train and hold the passengers in this front car hostage. One of the hijackers, Bashkim (Victor Gojcaj), kills an undercover police officer in the course of the action. Ryder and a former MTA train operator named Ramos settle down in the front of the car, while the other hijackers watch the hostages in the back. They demand $10 million in ransom money to be paid within 60 minutes. For each minute past the deadline, one passenger will be killed. Garber and Ryder exchange conversations through the microphone, while his men set up a wi-fi booster apparatus to enable Ryder to access his laptop in the tunnel to watch the stock market plunge nearly 1,000 points during the next hour.     \n\nSharing is caring.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4411ae612ebfd238750fd3c0ce91a53ec7a3527f","amp;dn":"Taking.of.Pelham.1.2.3.2009.720p.BluRay.DTS.x264-titul","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4411ae612ebfd238750fd3c0ce91a53ec7a3527f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,17,174,97,46,191,210,56,117,15,211,192,206,145,165,62,199,163,82,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
