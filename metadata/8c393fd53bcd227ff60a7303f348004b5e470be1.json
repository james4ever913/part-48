Dylan didn't want the record to be released, and it's easy to see why -- the album is a collection of covers that are poorly performed on purpose. Tackling both contemporary writers (Joni Mitchell's &quot;Big Yellow Taxi,&quot; Jerry Jeff Walker's &quot;Mr. Bojangles&quot;), pop songs (&quot;Can't Help Falling in Love,&quot; &quot;A Fool Such as I&quot;), and traditional numbers (&quot;The Ballad of Ira Hayes,&quot; &quot;Spanish Is the Loving Tongue&quot;), Dylan attempts to sabotage each number, but none of the results is quite so shocking, or funny, as the deconstructions on Self Portrait. While Dylan is indeed a negligible album, it isn't unlistenable -- it has a pleasant pop/rock sheen and Dylan sings in his Nashville Skyline croon. Nevertheless, its primary appeal is to die-hard fans with a perverse sense of humor.\n\nThis is my first torrent upload, so I hope it goes well, but I'm doing it anonymously in case there are problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c393fd53bcd227ff60a7303f348004b5e470be1","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan+-+Dylan+%281973%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c393fd53bcd227ff60a7303f348004b5e470be1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,57,63,213,59,205,34,127,246,10,115,3,243,72,0,75,94,71,11,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
