Hope It's ok.  3 Disk version of the Chilian revolution and counter-revolution.  It's shot in the 1970's on an old video camera do it wont be in HD lol.  This film seems quite relevant to me at the moment with the situation of the many uprisings in the middle east and Africa.\n\n\nOn September 11, 1973, President Salvador AllendeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s democratically-elected Chilean government was overthrown in a bloody coup by General Augusto Pinochet's army.\n\nPatricio GuzmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n and five colleagues had been filming the political developments in Chile throughout the nine months leading up to that day. The bombing of the Presidential Palace, during which Allende died, would now become the ending for GuzmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s seminal documentary THE BATTLE OF CHILE, an epic chronicle of that country's open and peaceful socialist revolution, and of the violent counter-revolution against it.\n\nAfter its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival and winning eight Grand Prize awards at other international festivals, when THE BATTLE OF CHILE came to the United States it was immediately hailed by critics as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSpellbindingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œOverwhelmingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, and as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAn epic!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\n\nThe Village Voice called it ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe major political film of our time,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and the San Francisco Chronicle ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA landmark in the presentation of living history on film.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nLong banned in Chile after PinochetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s coup, only in 1997 could GuzmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡n return to show THE BATTLE OF CHILE there for the first time. CHILE, OBSTINATE MEMORY (included on the fourth disc here) is the extraordinarily moving record of that homecoming, and a fitting conclusion to a ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthrilling documentary double feature,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe unusual opportunity to see one film artist sustain an inquiry into the life of a troubled country over the course of decades.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6402f5e1cb8f242d8f12f2db4d8f1c0019e29e87","amp;dn":"Battle+of+Chili%283+disk%2C+Spanish+with+Eng+subtitles+hardcoded%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6402f5e1cb8f242d8f12f2db4d8f1c0019e29e87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,2,245,225,203,143,36,45,143,18,242,219,77,143,28,0,25,226,158,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
