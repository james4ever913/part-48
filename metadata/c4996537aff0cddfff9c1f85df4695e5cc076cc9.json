Starring Aiden Gillen, Jack Shepherd and Charlotte Emmerson.\n\nHaunted by the death of his wife, 1930s Studio Head Monroe Stahr works eighteen hour days, each one a collision of talent meetings, set visits, script brainstorms and preview screenings. He's the &quot;last of the princes&quot;, is making the studio millions and seems bullet proof.\n\nAt the end of an epic day, an earthquake breaks two water mains, sending a roaring river of water through the studio. And with it, the huge floating head of the goddess Shiva - a film prop.\n\nAs Stahr leaves his office to inspect the damage he sees the head floating by and on it two women, one of them the mesmerising Kathleen.\n\nIt's the beginning of a love affair that will destroy him.\n\nAs their affair plays out, we follow the disintegration of one of the great Hollywood legends, and also witness the darker heart of the Hollywood machine as a paranoid fear of communism comes to the fore.\n\nIt's a gorgeous, excruciating, heady tale - based on Fitzgerald's own painful experiences working in Hollywood as a screenwriter.\n\nProduced by Laurence Bowen\nAdapted and directed by Bill Bryden\nProduction Associate - John Tams\nSound Design - Mark Smith\n\nA Feelgood Fiction production for BBC Radio 4.\n\nCredits\nAuthor - F.
