It looks like theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re trying to get into shape by running from the truth. At least President Obama is making that as difficult as possible for them. Obama continues to try and reach out to Republicans.  The PresidentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s strategy is to force the Republicans to make serious compromises or be seen as the obstructionists they are. HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s making it more difficult for them to say ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œnoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ when theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re accused of being the party of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œno.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The way it stands now, the Republicans wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get off the potÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ and they wonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t do the alternative either. They just sit in there and yell ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s occupied!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ every time somebody knocks. \n\nBut itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not just the President that the Republicans have to run from. TheyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re running just as frantically from their own pasts, as John McCain so clearly demonstrated during the hearings on the militaryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Ask DonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t TellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ policy.  Three years ago McCain said he would end DADT if the military leadership recommended that: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe day that the leadership of the military comes to me and says, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Senator, we ought to change the policy,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ then I think we ought to consider seriously changing it.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ That day is here, Senator. Check your calendar. I just donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t think he suspected that day would fall when heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s in a primary battle against a far-rightwing challenger. So yesterday McCain did a crisp military 180 degree turn and called DADT ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œimperfect but effective.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Yes, if the effect you want is to cripple the ability of our military to function. Heck, in that sense, DADT is almost perfect. \n\nFor an amusing example of a rightwing pundit running from their own words, check out this link.  After his boss Roger Ailes was called out over Glenn BeckÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s incendiary rants about the Obama administration ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œslaughteringÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ people, Beck himself denied he had ever said the word ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œslaughter.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ HereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s some advice, GlennÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½if somebody accuses you of saying something crazy, chances are you said it. And the tapes prove it. Beck flat out warned his viewers ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThey are taking you to a place to be slaughtered!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ You can imagine how frightening that image is to a bunch of sheep like Glenn BeckÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s audience.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07b160fd3211345a2d4e406dc24b4fddfb068384","amp;dn":"Randi+Rhodes+Show+-+Feb+03+2010","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07b160fd3211345a2d4e406dc24b4fddfb068384","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,177,96,253,50,17,52,90,45,78,64,109,194,75,79,221,251,6,131,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
