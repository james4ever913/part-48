Place dormitories and cellblocks, mess halls and gymnasiums, but don&amp;#039;t expect to be able to build death row right away.\n\nWhen you begin you will have a low security rating and must, with effort and managerial skill, improve your prison, maintain inmate discipline and increase your security to maximum. As time passes more inmates will arrive and you must deal with each new influx as they step off the prison bus, all of them needing to be housed and fed.\n\nRaise funds for the upkeep of your inmates, staff and facilities by building on-site factories where your inmates can work. Will you rehabilitate offenders by allowing them learn trade skills or educate themselves while in prison, or discuss their issues with the prison Therapist? Or will you simply send in the guards to quell unrest...\n\n\nMinimum Requirements \nMS Win 98SE, ME, 2000, XP; Pentium III 800MHz or better; 128MB RAM; 32MB DirectX compatible video card; 450MB HD space; DirectX compatible sound card\n\n\nRecommended Requirements\nMS Win XP; Pentium IV 2.0 GHz or equivalent; 256 MB RAM; 64 MB DirectX compatible video card; 450MB HD space\nDirectX compatible sound card\n\n\nFor ScreenShots Please Visit The Link Below: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.prisontycoon.com/pages/screens.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.prisontycoon.com/pages/screens.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f486dc00c73fe91487fff1a92acd27af9c915032","amp;dn":"Prison+Tycoon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f486dc00c73fe91487fff1a92acd27af9c915032","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,134,220,0,199,63,233,20,135,255,241,169,42,205,39,175,156,145,80,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
