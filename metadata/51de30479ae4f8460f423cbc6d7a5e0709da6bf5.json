Adela Quested arrives in Chandrapore, India, prepared to marry a British magistrate who exemplifies the narrow-minded, anti-Indian projudices of the imperial bureaucracy. But she soon meets the charming and mercurial Dr. Aziz, who offers to show her the &quot;real&quot; India. An expedition to the famed Marabar caves ends in explosive accusations and a schism that foreshadows the eventual end of British rule in India. Sam Dastor brilliantly evokes the Indian scenes and accents that make this story so intriguing.\n\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â©1924, 1979 The Provost and Scholars of King's College, Cambridge; (P)1994 Chivers Audio Books\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51de30479ae4f8460f423cbc6d7a5e0709da6bf5","amp;dn":"E+M+Forster+-+A+Passage+to+India++%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51de30479ae4f8460f423cbc6d7a5e0709da6bf5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,222,48,71,154,228,248,70,15,66,60,188,109,122,94,7,9,218,107,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
