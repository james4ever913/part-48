ICM369\n***************************************\n\nIf these songs really are The Greatest Hits Of 1998 then it was a \nterribly sad year for music! 40 tracks on two CDs and barely a \nhandful of decent tracks among them. \n\nDisc One:\n_________\n \nLet Me Entertain You by Robbie Williams is brilliant, \nRobbie at his very best. \nBrimful Of Asha by CornerShop defies description. \nA simple tune, lyrics quirky to the point of incomprehensiblity yet... \nit's fantastic!\n\nSadly, that's it for really good tracks but worthy of mention are;\nTorn by Natalie Imbruglia, a nice bit of easy listening \nand Say You Love Me by Simply Red, a standard Drunken Last Dance \nAt The Disco number,a potential deal closer for the would be Romeo\n... Just not one of their best though.\n\nThe rest are truly dismal / abysmal / bad beyond belief with the very \nworst being; The Ballard Of Tom Jones by Space With Cerys Of Catatonia \nand Doctor Jones by Aqua but a special place in Hell is reserved for \nVindaloo and Three Lions. Football Anthems. Say no more. Please!\n\n\nDisc Two:  \n_________\n\nThe best is undoubtably Life Is A Flower by Ace Of Base which I honestly \ndon't remember hearing at the time but it's really rather good nonetheless, \nalso Its Like That by Run DMC vs Jason Nevins is worth memtioning.\nFeel It by The Tamperer Feat Maya, High by The Lighthouse Family and \nReal Good Time by Alda are also worthy of note.\n \nKung Fu Fighting by Bus Stop Feat &amp; Carl Douglas is truly bad and an insult\nto the original which was equally fantastic. \nSad to see Carl has sunk to these levels. What next, a guest spot on the new \nseries of Noddy: The Ninja Years?. \n\nIt's very hard to pick out the worst of this dross but When I Need You by \nWill Mellors [a cover of the Leo Sayer classic] is truly awful and; \nSex On The Beach and Toms Party both by T-Spoon scrape so far beyond the \nbottom of the barrel.\n\nPerhaps 1998 genuinely was a crap year when it came to music or, maybe the \npeople who picked the tracks are in desperate need of a taste transplant, \neither way the vast majority of these 40 tracks are in real and undeniable \nbreach of the Trades Descriptions Act. \n\nThis two CD set recently sold on eBay for the princely sum of 50 pence \n[plus Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£2.00 P&amp;P] and even at that price they must have seen that poor sucker, \nsorry buyer, coming. \nThe other dozen copies failed to reach the more appropriate starting price of \none single penny. Say No More!\n\nNote: \n_____\n\nBut hey......everyone is entitled to there own opinions, and people will \nlike diferent tracks to this review, which was not mine by the way. \n\nICM369\n\nCD 1\n____ \n\n 1.
