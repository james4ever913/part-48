He covers the elections, goes through a list of reasons why itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s illegal to take pics of your voting ballot, and we look at some new and old timey campaign ads. We hear a story about Michelle Obama and fried chicken, he discusses scare and racial tactics when pushing an election agenda, and we watch a Bill Maher clip as well as one from Ben Stein. We see a compilation of Ã¢â‚¬Å“fuck her in the pussyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ videos, read some internet feedback on Brittany Maynard taking her own life, learn about a new texting while driving law in New York, Ant invites Amanda Bynes crazy ass to come live at his house, and the show ends with us learning just how much Anthony hates Stephen King","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dee7fd49a5197b78836097aea211796f45e3a76e","amp;dn":"TACS+-+The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+2014-11-04","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dee7fd49a5197b78836097aea211796f45e3a76e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,231,253,73,165,25,123,120,131,96,151,174,162,17,121,111,69,227,167,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
