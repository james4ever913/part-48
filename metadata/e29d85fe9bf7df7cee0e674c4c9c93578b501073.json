Apparently, it had to do something with the sound driver on the computer I have been doing the editing on. Converting from the raw stream to PCM data on another computer resulted in no whistles and such.\n\n\nThe sound is from the SR live stream, and ripping and (minimal) editing has been done by pettter.\n\n\nOne final note: The SR stream was unavailable for the first few minutes of the days proceedings, and thus this is missing from this rip. If anyone managed to rip the beginning from another source, please comment with a link to your rip. Alternatively, email me at pettter |at| acc dot umu dot se if you are unable or unwilling to seed on your own.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e29d85fe9bf7df7cee0e674c4c9c93578b501073","amp;dn":"The+Pirate+Bay+trial+-+day+three+in+parts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e29d85fe9bf7df7cee0e674c4c9c93578b501073","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,157,133,254,155,247,223,124,238,14,103,76,76,156,147,87,139,80,16,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
