Most of our work on BT\nwas put on BT by people that show it off as their work. We don&amp;#039;t like it,\nbut it doesn&amp;#039;t matter to us. Just remember that we know who we are talking\nabout, and that they shouldn&amp;#039;t be underestimating us.\n\nFLAME runs on 370 servers located in the Netherlands. Each is served by 12\nT3 lines.\n\n{F2} Humble: I got permission to release this on BT as long as I included\nBV&amp;#039;s readme.\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nShouts to:\n\nAll my Halo buddies, thanks for all the help.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:18e5b20a940132a3197f3a8e5dcdbe372b3a4755","amp;dn":"Halo+PC+-+Ultimate+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"18e5b20a940132a3197f3a8e5dcdbe372b3a4755","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,229,178,10,148,1,50,163,25,127,58,142,93,205,190,55,43,58,71,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
