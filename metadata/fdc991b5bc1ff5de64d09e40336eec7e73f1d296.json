Mr. Levine is the author of Surviving America's Depression Epidemic and Commonsense Rebellion: Taking Back Your Life from Drugs, Shrinks, Corporations, and a World Gone Crazy. Levine provides a compelling alternative approach to treating depression that makes lasting change more likely than with symptom-based treatment through medication. Dr. Levine has been a regular contributor to AlterNet, Z Magazine, and The Huffington Post and his articles and interviews have been published in Adbusters, The Ecologist, High Times and numerous other magazines. He is an editorial advisor for the Icarus Project/Freedom Center Harm Reduction Guide to Coming Off Psychiatric Drugs and on the editorial advisory board of the journal Ethical Human Psychology and Psychiatry. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.brucelevine.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.brucelevine.net/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Levine&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Levine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.alternet.org/healthwellness/75081/?page=entire&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.alternet.org/healthwellness/75081/?page=entire&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nAlex also covers the latest news and takes a number of calls.\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance.
