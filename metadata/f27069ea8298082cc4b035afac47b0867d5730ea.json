There are some nice things on here, but too many are buried under the Nashville Sound and don't seem to be able to stand on their own. Not great, but you could do worse.\n\n/Allmusic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f27069ea8298082cc4b035afac47b0867d5730ea","amp;dn":"Willie+Nelson+-+Laying+My+Burdens+Down+%281970%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f27069ea8298082cc4b035afac47b0867d5730ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,112,105,234,130,152,8,44,196,176,53,175,172,71,176,134,125,87,48,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
