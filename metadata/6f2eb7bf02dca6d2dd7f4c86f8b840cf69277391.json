It's one of those great forgotten bits of 80's obscura. The Hitmen, fronted by Ben Watkins, recorded their first album &quot;Aim for the Feet&quot; in 1980 under the Urgent Records division of Columbia. It's pretty light but listenable stuff (along the lines of more familiar bands of the era such as The Romantics, The Producers, or Graham Parker and The Rumour) but ultimately forgettable. Their second release, 1981's &quot;Torn Together&quot; leads off with &quot;Bates Motel&quot;, a rich, murky, yet danceable gem that sets the tone for the rest of the album. The upgrade in style is not too surprising considering this outing was produced by Rhett Davies (who is also associated with Talking Heads, Roxy Music, and Icehouse, among many others).\n\nAim For The Feet (1980)\n01 OK\n02 Private Eye\n03 She's All Mine\n04 Kid's Stuff\n05 Guess Who\n06 I Still Remember\n07 Slay Me With Your 45\n08 Eyes Open\n09 Bad Timing\n10 Hold On to Her\n\nTorn Together (1981)\n01 Bates Motel\n02 What Would The Neighbors Say\n03 Picking Up The Pulse\n04 Score It Blue\n05 The Hard Heartbeat\n06 Don't Speak With The Enemy\n07 Shade In Fade Out\n08 Changing Faces\n\nAlbum cover images are included.
