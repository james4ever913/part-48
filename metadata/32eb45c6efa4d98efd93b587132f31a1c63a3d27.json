The character of the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t changed dramatically but the quality hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t gone down either.\n\nI may be imagining things, but the sound seems less contented than it used to be, with fewer longueurs, and when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re working with this kind of beat-driven, rhythm-driven electro-samba-boogie-and-other-styles mix, then thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s actually a plus. The Ã¢â‚¬Å“Light SideÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ set is tuned to the personality of Oliver HusmannÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cavaquinho and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dark SideÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ reminds you that the programmer Ane H. came from an industrial noise background. Mariana Da Cruz sounds as if sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s having the time of her life on vocals","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32eb45c6efa4d98efd93b587132f31a1c63a3d27","amp;dn":"Da+Cruz+-+Disco+E+Progresso+%282014%29+%5BUrban+Brazilian+Disco%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32eb45c6efa4d98efd93b587132f31a1c63a3d27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,235,69,198,239,164,217,142,253,147,181,135,19,47,49,161,198,58,61,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
