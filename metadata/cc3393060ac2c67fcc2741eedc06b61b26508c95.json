Inspired by the works of Combichrist, Grendel, Colony 5\nand Funker Vogt, the EP deals with themes such as war, destruction, human\nignorance and decay. The tracks features blasting electronic dancebeats,\nscreaming synth loops and powerful lyrics, in what could be defined as a fresh\nmixture of EBM, synthpop and industrial.\nThe title song, Fallout, is inspired by the Fallout games and\npartly written as to celebrate the release third installment in the series.\nThe EP also features a dance remix of the song Rise, mixed by Jester Project.\n\nThis EP is released under Creative Commons licence, because culture is\nsomething that belongs to everyone, and shouldn&amp;#039;t be a privilege for the rich :)\n\nFor more information, lyrics and ways to support the band visit:\nwww.sturmreaktor.com       ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc3393060ac2c67fcc2741eedc06b61b26508c95","amp;dn":"Sturmreaktor+-+Fallout+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc3393060ac2c67fcc2741eedc06b61b26508c95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,51,147,6,10,194,198,127,204,39,65,238,220,6,182,27,38,80,140,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
