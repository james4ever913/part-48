It's a completely and unprecedented approach to a story in comics history. There are no parallels. We refuse to accept it.\n\nTeam Young Avengers are joined by an all-start cast of some people we really like. Each individual section gets one individual artist. It's a metaphor, probably.\n\nIt's been one hell of a year. In two episodes, one before and one after the new year, the Young Avengers get resolution. You guys do as well.\n\nIn Shops: 12/18/2013\n$2.99","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4f9db14cd8910c95e5bff6572d635d5e877b678","amp;dn":"YOUNG+AVENGERS+014+%282014%29+%28Digital%29+RESOLUTION+PART+1+%28Zone-Empi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4f9db14cd8910c95e5bff6572d635d5e877b678","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,249,219,20,205,137,16,201,94,91,255,101,114,214,53,213,232,119,182,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
