Works for both 32bit and 64bit Windows XP!\n\nWhat This Does.. \n\nI've created a set of .bat (MS-DOS batch) files that register about 40 .dll files to your copy of windows.. these files need to be registered in order for Windows Update to work (Mainly the file &quot;wups2.dll&quot;) \n\nwhat this partly automated package does is stop automatic update while it registers the necessary .dll files and then restarts the automatic update service!\n\ni created this becuase i needed it myself, so it's been tested and I made sure it completely works before releasing it! :) \n\n-enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c67eb0e4db5c5637d45e3c9fe7f0aac34bad0f48","amp;dn":"Windows+Update+XP+x86x64+Freeze+Fix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c67eb0e4db5c5637d45e3c9fe7f0aac34bad0f48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,126,176,228,219,92,86,55,212,94,60,159,231,240,170,195,75,173,15,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
