Drawn from sides recorded for the Topic and Greentrax imprints, it includes examples of his fine acoustic guitar playing (&quot;Coppers and Brass/The Gander in the Pratie Hole&quot;), his interpretations of the traditional Scottish story ballads he calls &quot;muckle songs&quot; (the tense and drone-driven &quot;Dowie Dens O Yarrow&quot;), his covers of contemporary songwriters (tunes by Lal Waterson, Hamish Henderson, and Ron Kavana), and his own songs (&quot;Both Sides the Tweed,&quot; which closes things here). &quot;Dowie Dens O Yarrow&quot; is particularly powerful, as are Gaughan's versions of Lal and Mike Waterson's cinematic &quot;Scarecrow&quot; and Ashley Hutchings' rewritten and reformatted &quot;Young Henry Martin.&quot; At a dozen tracks, though, this set only begins to scratch the surface of a nearly 40-year career. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2010/10/22/dick-gaughan/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b640a2137be1d4d23424ef99f82456f4fbda931","amp;dn":"Dick+Gaughan...The+Definitive+Collection%282006%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b640a2137be1d4d23424ef99f82456f4fbda931","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,100,10,33,55,190,29,77,35,66,78,249,159,130,69,111,79,189,169,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
