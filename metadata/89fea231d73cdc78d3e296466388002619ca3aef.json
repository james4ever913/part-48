Both traditional and modern methods are presented, including state-of-the-art techniques for statistical process monitoring and control and statistically designed experiments for process characterization, optimization, and process robustness studies. The seventh edition continues to focus on DMAIC (define, measure, analyze, improve, and control--the problem-solving strategy of six sigma) including a chapter on the implementation process. Additionally, the text includes new examples, exercises, problems, and techniques. Statistical Quality Control is best suited for students in engineering, statistics, business and management science or students in undergraduate courses","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89fea231d73cdc78d3e296466388002619ca3aef","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Statistical+Quality+Control+%287th+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89fea231d73cdc78d3e296466388002619ca3aef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,254,162,49,215,60,220,120,211,226,150,70,99,136,0,38,25,202,58,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
