By freezing domestic spending and not touching these other things the US is being put on a de facto war footing.\n\n[money quote]:\n&quot;I am offended and ashamed that the US government is going to go start a war with another of Israel's enemies to the impoverishment of the United States of America and our people, to the destruction of our moral standing in the world.  And, it's a war that we're at least going to get mired in, and if Russia and China come it it's going to be a World War and we're going to lose it!&quot;\n\n\nHour 2:\n\nAn update on the April 15th &quot;tax strike&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://taxfree15.com/ActionPlan.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://taxfree15.com/ActionPlan.aspx&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe horrors [for &quot;them&quot; and &quot;us&quot;] created by US military use of depleted uranium munitions;\nUS government preparing to revise 2009 unemployment numbers significantly upward -- they'll sell it as a simple calculation error;\nstates' revenues continue to decline.  Their response: we'll have to take more and more services away from the people;\nthe IRS is stocking up on short-barreled shotguns; \nand much more news.\n\n\n\nMike manages to present powerful, persuasive stuff without screaming and yelling.\nPlease give his show a listen.\n\n\n\n_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/_/\n \n It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually\n essential to seek information from a variety of sources, \n to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better \n understand the &quot;big picture.&quot; A reliance solely upon\n mainstream corporate media for news and info is a \n prescription for ignorance. I try to share information\n that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.\n NOTE: The material here is made available strictly as\n information.

What Really Happened is proud to be one of the oldest political blogs on the net.\nRivero runs the WhatReallyHappened radio show on GCN six days a week, and makes good use of his sharp wit to help his blog visitors and radio listeners not only to read/hear the news but to understand what IS really happening. \n\n===============================================================\n.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f452f89e1a903152a24f802e663c19b93897ef0","amp;dn":"What+Really+Happened+-+2010+Feb+03+WE+%5Bsebaygo1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f452f89e1a903152a24f802e663c19b93897ef0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,69,47,137,225,169,3,21,42,36,248,2,230,99,193,155,147,137,126,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
