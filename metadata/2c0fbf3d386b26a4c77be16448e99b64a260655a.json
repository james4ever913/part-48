The recording was done in San Diego during the first of two tours in 1977. Probably ment to end up on the live album &quot;Tv Eye&quot;, but never made it.\n\nQuality is excellent, the backing band (including Bowie) is not.. Many people claim that this was period was Iggy at his best. Well..it certainly wasn't Iggy at his best live. The Stooges songs are ruined (I guess Bowie was the &quot;mastermind&quot; behind the new arrangements)-and even Iggy can't save this sinking ship.. Even so, if you're like me- and collect Iggy stuff, you'd probably wanna have this anyway. \n\nIggy Pop (vocals), David Bowie (keyboards and backing vocals), \nRicky Gardiner (guitar), Tony Sales (bass) and Hunt Sales (drums)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c0fbf3d386b26a4c77be16448e99b64a260655a","amp;dn":"Iggy+Pop-+Wild+Animal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c0fbf3d386b26a4c77be16448e99b64a260655a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,15,191,61,56,107,38,164,199,123,225,100,72,233,155,100,162,96,101,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
