I decided against including the Ron Bennington Interviews with these cause I just found this site that has them all up, not sure how often they update but it looks pretty good to me so far. &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.ronbenningtoninterviews.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.ronbenningtoninterviews.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI didn't include the Dec. 24th show because it was a replay of the Sleeves and Perrynoid which is available on the November 2008 Torrent.  Also Dec 29ths Best Of was messed up from someone from XM, the first 15 minutes was an O&amp;A replay.\n\nThe last week and a half of shows was all Best Ofs; the great Christmas song show is also there of course.\n\nWell enjoy buddays!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c4d4c20704dfc7884394b329d30e4e9a0bf4d78","amp;dn":"Ron+and+Fez+December+2008+Shows+64kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c4d4c20704dfc7884394b329d30e4e9a0bf4d78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,77,76,32,112,77,252,120,132,57,75,50,157,48,228,233,160,191,77,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
