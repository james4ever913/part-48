At age 25, he published his doctoral dissertation, On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, which examined the fundamental question of whether reason alone can unlock answers about the world. Schopenhauer's most influential work, The World as Will and Representation, emphasized the role of man's basic motivation, which Schopenhauer called will. Schopenhauer's analysis of will led him to the conclusion that emotional, physical, and sexual desires can never be fulfilled. Consequently, Schopenhauer favored a lifestyle of negating human desires, similar to the teachings of Buddhism and Vedanta.\nSchopenhauer's metaphysical analysis of will, his views on human motivation and desire, and his aphoristic writing style influenced many well-known thinkers, including Friedrich Nietzsche, Richard Wagner, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Erwin Schrodinger, and Sigmund Freud.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d003967b1de693551f3935f50f55757bb4854193","amp;dn":"Paul+Strathern+-+Schopenhauer+in+90+minutes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d003967b1de693551f3935f50f55757bb4854193","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,3,150,123,29,230,147,85,31,57,53,245,15,85,117,123,180,133,65,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
