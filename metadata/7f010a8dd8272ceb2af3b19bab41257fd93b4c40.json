Combining standards like &quot;Misty,&quot; &quot;As Time Goes By,&quot; &quot;Feelings,&quot; and others with his original tunes, Merl has produced a work strong on melody and harmony, yet spiced with imagination. Meridien Dreams is a beautiful and shimmering recording","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f010a8dd8272ceb2af3b19bab41257fd93b4c40","amp;dn":"Merl+Saunders+-+Meridien+Dreams+%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f010a8dd8272ceb2af3b19bab41257fd93b4c40","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,1,10,141,216,39,44,235,42,243,177,155,171,65,37,127,217,59,76,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
