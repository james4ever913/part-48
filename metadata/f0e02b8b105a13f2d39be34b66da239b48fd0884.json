D'You Know What I Mean? - 7:22\n2. Stay Young - 5:06\n3. Angel Child (demo) - 4:28\n4. Heroes (David Bowie/Brian Eno)- 4:09\n\n\n&quot;D'You Know What I Mean?&quot; is a song by British rock band Oasis. It was the first single from their third album Be Here Now. It reached #1 in the UK singles chart, the 3rd Oasis song to do so. The song was written by Noel Gallagher. It was certified platinum for UK sales.\n\nThe guitar chords on both the verse and the chorus are similar to the chords used for the Oasis single &quot;Wonderwall&quot; (F#m7/A/Esus4/Bsus4).\n\nThe song also shows more of Noel's influences. References include Bob Dylan (&quot;Blood on the tracks and they must be mine&quot;) and The Beatles (&quot;Fool on the hill and I feel fine&quot;). The song also features a drum loop from N.W.A.\n\nThe Morse code in the background translates to include such sayings as &quot;bugger all&quot;, &quot;pork pies&quot; and &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever.&quot;\n\nOne of the B-sides, &quot;Stay Young&quot;, has become a popular Oasis song, so much so that fans voted it onto the B-sides collection The Masterplan - one of only two B-sides from the Be Here Now period which made the album.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0e02b8b105a13f2d39be34b66da239b48fd0884","amp;dn":"Oasis+-+DYou+Know+What+I+Mean%3F+-+4+Track+EP+-+FLAC++%5Bakhiugo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0e02b8b105a13f2d39be34b66da239b48fd0884","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,224,43,139,16,90,19,242,211,155,227,75,102,218,35,155,72,253,8,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
