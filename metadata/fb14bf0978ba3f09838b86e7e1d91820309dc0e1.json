He comes from a long line of mascots in his family, but it turns out that he can't do it because he's allergic to the costume. So his shy best friend, Pete (Jason Dolley), does it for him. But when Poole starts becoming popular for being the mascot, and people don't know that it's really Pete, trouble starts between the friends.\n\ntorrent downloaded from http://place2bscene.co.uk/ plz come and join us","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb14bf0978ba3f09838b86e7e1d91820309dc0e1","amp;dn":"Hatching.Pete.2009.STV.DVDRiP.XviD-DVSKY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb14bf0978ba3f09838b86e7e1d91820309dc0e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,20,191,9,120,186,63,9,131,139,134,231,225,217,24,32,48,157,192,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
