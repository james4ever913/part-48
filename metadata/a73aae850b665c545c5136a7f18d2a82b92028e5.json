The Command &amp; Conquer series was initially developed \nby Westwood Studios between 1995 and 2003, with development being taken over by \nElectronic Arts with the liquidation of Westwood Studios in 2003. Command &amp; \nConquer: The First Decade is a compilation of the Command &amp; Conquer series' \ngames published from 1995 to 2003, all bundled into one DVD and updated to run \noptimally on Windows XP. It was released on February 7, 2006 and sold for the \nprice of one retail game.\n\nThis release includes all of the games retailed in the First Decade compilation\nas well as their original manuals and cover art. It has also been upgraded\nto be both portable and thinner, while utilizing less active memory. Several \nscripts have additionally been added to prevent crashes related to Vista \nincompatibility. It is also noteworthy that all E.A. and Westwood video logos \nhave also been removed (with the exception of Yuri's Revenge for technical reasons\ndescribed bellow) out of respect for the former Westwood employees whose past \nefforts should be recognized, not exploited and rebranded.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                              Miscellaneous Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n.I.\nThe Federation takes no responsibility for any damage that may come to \ncomputer through the trial of this game. This release has been tested to \nwork on Windows XP and Vista. No support or technical assistance will be provided. \nEver. Creation of this release took many hours of unpaid labour. \n.II.\nMultiplayer functionality is limited to the games whose default functionality\noriginally included the required components.\n.III.\nMost of the games included in this release were intended for the IPX protocol.\nAs this protocol is utilized the Federation utilized a LAN patch created by\nmembers of Understorm (http://www.understorm.net/) to ensure multiplayer \nfunctionality. We take no credit for their work.\n.IV.\nThe binary distributed with Yuri's Revenge, by E.A. has been set to ignore \nsettings in the artmd.ini file, preventing the Federation from removing the \nwrapped logo videos. It is possible that through the injection techniques \nutilized in RockPatch2, a logo removing fix will be created, but at this time \nthere is no working solution.\n.V.\nTo all the Fans, Friends, Foes, Members and Affiliates, of the FEDERATION:\n\n\t\t\t-----------------------\n\t\t\t|THANKS FOR EVERYTHING| \n                        -----------------------\n\nBecause of you we are &quot;STILL UNDERGROUND&quot; and &quot;STILL ALIVE&quot;.\n[54686f73652057686f204b6e6f772055732043616e2046696e64205573]\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Install Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteps:\n\n(1.) Extract the &quot;Command and Conquer - THe First Decade.rar&quot; file to a directory  \nof your choice and then Navigate to the extracted directory (by default this is \nthe &quot;Command and Conquer - The First Decade&quot; directory). Double-click on the \nbinary/executablewhose name corresponds with the desired game.\n\nNote: This release is portable and therefore the binaries/executables within \nmake no changes to the game/system files which are already updated, modded, \nand cracked.\n\n\nBinary:\n\n&quot;COMMAND AND CONQUER - GENERALS&quot;\t     - Real-Time Strategy Gameplay\n&quot;COMMAND AND CONQUER - ORIGINAL&quot;\t     - Real-Time Strategy Gameplay\n&quot;COMMAND AND CONQUER - RED ALERT&quot;\t     - Real-Time Strategy Gameplay\n&quot;COMMAND AND CONQUER - RED ALERT TWO&quot;        - Real-Time Strategy Gameplay\n&quot;COMMAND AND CONQUER - RED ALERT TWO - YURI&quot; - Real-Time Strategy Gameplay\n&quot;COMMAND AND CONQUER - RENEGADE&quot;     \t     - First Person Gameplay\n&quot;COMMAND AND CONQUER - TIBERIAN SUN&quot;         - Real-Time Strategy Gameplay\n\nNote: The official manuals, and covers are located in the &quot;.EXTRAS&quot; directory.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  In The Pipeline\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nT-BOX - ZKZ of the Federation Team\n\nGames - Pending\nEMUs  - Complete\nNFO   - Pending\nTest  - Complete\n\nThis release is imminent. This project seeks to combine a Lite (less than 700m)\nVista build, bootscreen, frontend, registry tweaks, several related \napplications, twenty-plus emulators and tens of thousands of various game \nimages and ROMS in an orderly package. This package would then allow a user \nto easily create a SF personal computer (or any other light PC) that would \nact as any console from the first to sixth generation. This has been a huge\nundertaking but if it is successful this project will provide the PC scene with \nthe first real replacement for consoles. Please understand that projects like \nthis one can have unsuspected kinks. Please be patient.\n\nFarCry Co-op - BHD UPDATE*\n\nGame  - Complete\nCrack - Complete\nNFO   - Pending\nMod   - Complete\nTest  - Complete - Loads of Fun\n\nThis update will include the Black Hawk Down Assault Co-op mini mod made for \nFarCry.

Once they have a clean version \nworking, this Crack-Mod will be released.
