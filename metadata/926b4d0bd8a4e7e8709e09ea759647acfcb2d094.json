This allowed us for a much better rip and also slightly less cropped by a few pixels than other releases. We found some subs for the non-english parts that were made by birdflu. Worked done ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ increasing contrast; colours; sharpening; noise reduction; and hardcoding subs. Audio is the same as before supplied by mindfuck but filtered slightly different to last time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:926b4d0bd8a4e7e8709e09ea759647acfcb2d094","amp;dn":"Avatar+TS+XVID+Subbed+V2+%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C+IMAGiNE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"926b4d0bd8a4e7e8709e09ea759647acfcb2d094","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[146,107,77,11,216,164,231,232,112,158,9,234,117,150,71,172,252,178,208,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
