The challenges he faces are those of many fathers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ how to make ends meet, keep his wife and daughters happy and impress his daughterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s future in-laws. Things would be so much easier if everyone just listened to him and followed his lead, but his obsessively house-proud wife and two feisty daughters usually have other ideas.\n\n Citizen Khan was created by Adil Ray. The character Mr Khan has already featured in BBC Two comedy series BellamyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s People and on Radio FourÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Down the Line. In addition Mr Khan also hosted his own web series for the BBC Comedy website, in which he covered a variety of topics including the General Election, cricket and even delivered his own Christmas message to the nation.\n \n \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03c8nd8&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03c8nd8&lt;/a&gt;\n \n \n\n\n\n============= What's In This Torrent =============\n\n[b]\n\nCitizen Khan - S03 - E01 - Naani's Return\n \n\nCitizen Khan Series 01 And 02 search for\nCitizen Khan Slimoo\n\n\n[/b]\n\n===================== General =====================\nComplete name               : Citizen Khan.avi\nFormat                      : AVI\nFormat info                 : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                   : 350 MB\nDuration (ms)               : 28mn 30s\nOverallBitRate_Mode/String  : Variable\nTotal bitrate               : 1 716 Kbps\nEncoded application         : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nEncoded library             : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\n===================== Video =====================\nId                          : 0\nFormat                      : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile              : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings - BVOP      : 1\nFormat settings - QPel      : No\nFormat settings - GMC       : No warppoints\nFormat settings - Matrix    : Custom\nCodec Id                    : XVID\nCodec                       : XviD\nDuration (ms)               : 28mn 30s\nBitrate                     : 1 595 Kbps\nWidth                       : 720 pixels\nHeight                      : 416 pixels\nAspect ratio                : 1.731\nFramerate                   : 25.000 fps\nColorimetry                 : YUV\nColos space                 : 4:2:0\nBit depth                   : 8 bits\nScan type                   : Progressive\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)          : 0.213\nStream size                 : 325 MB (93%)\nEncoded library             : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\n===================== Audio =====================\nId                          : 1\nFormat                      : MPEG Audio\nFormat version              : Version 1\nFormat profile              : Layer 3\nFormat settings mode        : Joint stereo\nFormat settings mode extens : MS Stereo\nCodec Id                    : 55\nCodec                       : MP3\nDuration (ms)               : 28mn 30s\nBitrate mode                : Variable\nBitrate                     : 108 Kbps\nBitRate_Nominal/String      : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                  : 2 channels\nSampling rate               : 48.0 KHz\nCompression_Mode/String     : Lossy\nStream size                 : 22.1 MB (6%)\nAlignement                  : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave duration         : 24 ms (0.60 video frame)\nInterleave preload          : 619 ms\nEncoded library             : LAME3.98r\nEncoded library settings    : -m j -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 17 --abr 128","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fa2b46974e446f06f6f4d4cffc28c4fd21fed14","amp;dn":"Citizen+Khan+-+S03+-+E01+-+Sitcom+-+Xvid+-+Slimoo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fa2b46974e446f06f6f4d4cffc28c4fd21fed14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,162,180,105,116,228,70,240,111,111,77,76,255,194,140,79,210,31,237,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
