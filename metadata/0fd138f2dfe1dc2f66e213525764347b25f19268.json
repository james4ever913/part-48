The girls' first and last name started with the same letter, as did the first letter of the respective village they were dumped in. The film deviates significantly from established facts. (See Cheri Farnsworth's book, &quot;Alphabet Killer: The True Story of the Double Initial Murders&quot; for a detailed look at the real Alphabet murders.) [2][3]. In the movie, the filmmakers chose to focus on the personal aspect of their story and its impact on the lead character instead of the police procedure and investigation.[4] Writer Tom Malloy developed the script with the help of a homicide investigator who had worked on the original case. The writer noted that he saw the film as a cross between A Beautiful Mind and Zodiac.[5]\nDushku was an immediate choice for the lead role.[4] The filmmakers also deliberately chose certain actors who had earlier played the role of a killer in other films. The film was shot in and around Rochester. The climactic scene was shot near the High Falls of Genesee River.\n\nFORMAT:Matroska (MKV)\nFILE SIZE: 698 MiB\nWIDTH: 1280 pixels\nHEIGHT:720pixels\nASPECT RATIO:16:9\nFRAME RATE:23.976 fps\nVIDEO BITRATE: 898 Kbps\nAUDIO CHANNEL(s): Front: L R \nLANGUAGE: English\nSUBTITLES: No\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img691.imageshack.us/img691/3045/40193853.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img691.imageshack.us/img691/3045/40193853.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img266.imageshack.us/img266/9064/14628601.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img266.imageshack.us/img266/9064/14628601.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/6559/41633384.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/6559/41633384.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img257.imageshack.us/img257/2051/57243316.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img257.imageshack.us/img257/2051/57243316.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nPLZ.SEED AFTER DOWNLOAD.\n    PLZ.FEED BACK ABOUT THE TORRENT\nAND DON'T FORGET TO HIT THANKS \n    BUTTON TOP OF THIS PAGE IF YOU \nLIKE MAY POST.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0fd138f2dfe1dc2f66e213525764347b25f19268","amp;dn":"The+Alphabet+Killer+2008+BRRip+720p+x264+%7BSimba%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0fd138f2dfe1dc2f66e213525764347b25f19268","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,209,56,242,223,225,220,47,102,226,19,82,87,100,52,123,37,241,146,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
