Patrick's production of Credo marked a change in musical direction for Rush as it saw her exploring soulful ballads and contemporary R&amp;B, and working with African and Gospel choirs who backed her on three of the tracks, including the title track and lead single &quot;Credo&quot; (Latin for &quot;I Believe&quot;). The album also featured Rush's interpretations of soul and pop classics like Stevie Wonder's &quot;All In Love Is Fair&quot;,  Brenda Russell's &quot;Piano In The Dark&quot;, John Farnham's &quot;A Touch Of Paradise&quot; and Glen Ballard's &quot;The Places You Find Love&quot;, the latter previously covered by both Chaka Khan, Siedah Garrett and Barbra Streisand.\n\n\nTRACK LIST:\n\nOriginal album:\n\n01.
