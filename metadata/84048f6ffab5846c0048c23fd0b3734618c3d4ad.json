But for the most part, the other artists Roy chose to record were unknowns, apart from Tabby Diamond and the Heptones, who both cut singles for Phase One; Dean Fraser also recorded a sax cut ofTabby's take on Ken Boothe's &quot;Gonna Take A Miracle&quot;, and made a vocal under the name Jah Devon. Nevertheless, unknown singers like Lopez Walker and Errol Davis made superb sides for Phase One, while the releases of, Steve Boswell, Paul, The Terrors and Untouchables were not far behind.\n\n12 of the tracks are the disco 12ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ versions, sourced from both vinyl and CD. \n\nThis album is absolutely essential.\n\nThie vinyl needledrop used:\n\nLinn LP12, Lingo, Ekos and Dynavector XX2 moving coil cartridge.\n\nVia \n\nNaim 62 pre-amp.\n\nInto\n\nPioneer PDR-609 CDR.\n\nUsing\n\nTDK audio CDR.\n\nEAC rip\n\nCovers\n\nFLAC\n\nTracks\n\n1.\tWaiting in the Park : Chantells + Jah Berry\n2.\tHelp Us Jah : Untouchables\n3.\tHey You : Chantells + Barnabas\n4.\tWe Are Getting Bad : Steve Boswell\n5.\tTakes a Miracle : Tabby\n6.\tDeceivers : Heptones\n7.\tChildren of Jah : Chantells + U-Brown\n8.\tJah Jah New Garden : Lopez Walker\n9.\tPath I Have Taken : Errol Davis\n10.\tAssemble Not Thyself : The Terrors\n11.\tCool Rastaman Cool : Steve Boswell + Jah Berry\n12.\tTrail Days : Lopez Walker\n13.\tFly Away : Lopez Walker\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84048f6ffab5846c0048c23fd0b3734618c3d4ad","amp;dn":"Phase+One+12%5C%22+Reggae+Disco++Mix.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84048f6ffab5846c0048c23fd0b3734618c3d4ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,4,143,111,250,181,132,108,0,72,194,63,208,179,115,70,24,195,212,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
