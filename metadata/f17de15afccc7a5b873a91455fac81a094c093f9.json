This is a popular area, partially because the Hardy-Hilbert space is the most natural setting for operator theory.\n\nA reader who masters the material covered in this book will have acquired a firm foundation for the study of all spaces of analytic functions and of operators on them. The goal is to provide an elementary and engaging introduction to this subject that will be readable by everyone who has understood introductory courses in complex analysis and in functional analysis. The exposition, blending techniques from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œsoftÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ analysis, is intended to be as clear and instructive as possible. Many of the proofs are very elegant.\n\nThis book evolved from a graduate course that was taught at the University of Toronto. It should prove suitable as a textbook for beginning graduate students, or even for well-prepared advanced undergraduates, as well as for independent study. There are numerous exercises at the end of each chapter, along with a brief guide for further study which includes references to applications to topics in engineering.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f17de15afccc7a5b873a91455fac81a094c093f9","amp;dn":"An+Introduction+to+Operators+on+the+Hardy-Hilbert+Space","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f17de15afccc7a5b873a91455fac81a094c093f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,125,225,90,252,204,122,91,135,58,145,69,95,172,129,160,148,192,147,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
