One answer is to take the Eight Mahayana Precepts.\n\nThese precepts are a set of eight vows that are taken before dawn in a short, simple ceremony and kept for twenty-four hours. No matter whether you are ordained or lay, once you have received the transmission, you can take the precepts at any time for as long as you choose.\n\nThese Mahayana Precepts enable you to live in the essence of pure moral conduct, and since you take them with the strong motivation of cherishing and wishing to benefit others, their value is immeasurable. Taking these precepts is a powerful and effective way for you to build, maintain and increase deep propensities for spiritual practice and attainment and thus is a profound method for giving meaning to your precious human life.\n\nThis book is a practical guide. It explains the benefits of the vows and the meaning of the ceremony for receiving them, and for easy reference contains the ceremony itself, written out clearly for regular use. \n(Uploaded through the kind permission of)          &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.lamayeshe.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.lamayeshe.com&lt;/a&gt;\n***********************************************************************************\n*                                                                                 *\n*  *LYWA      *LYWA*      *LYWA* *LYWA   *LYWA   *LYWA    *LYWA   *LYWA*          *\n*   LYWA        LYWA      LYWA    LYWA    LYWA    LYWA     LYWA    *LYWA*         *\n*   LYWA         LYWA    LYWA      LYWA    LYWA  LYWA     LYWA    *L.Y.WA*        *\n*   LYWA          LYWA  LYWA       LYWA     LYWA LYWA     LYWA    LYWALYWA        *\n*   LYWA           LYWALYWA         LYWA    LYWALYWA     LYWA    LYWA  LYWA       *\n*   LYWA            L.Y.WA          LYWA     L.Y.WA      LYWA    LYWA  LYWA       *\n*   LYWA             LYWA            LYWA     LYWA*     LYWA    LYWA    LYWA      *\n*   LYWA             LYWA            LYWA     LYWA*     LYWA    LYWALYWALYWA      *\n*   LYWA             LYWA             LYWA   L.Y.W.A   LYWA    LYWA      LYWA     *\n*   LYWA             LYWA             LYWA  LYWA LYWA *LYWA    LYWA      LYWA     *\n*   LYWA             LYWA              LYWALYWA   LYWALYWA    LYWA        LYWA    *\n*   LYWA             LYWA              L.Y.W.A    L.Y.W.A     LYWA        LYWA    *\n*   LYWA             LYWA               LYWA*      LYWA*     LYWA          LYWA   *\n*  ~LYWA*LYWA*LYWA* ~LYWA~              LYWA       LYWA     ~LYWA~        ~LYWA~  *\n*                                                                                 *\n*      ~LAMA~      *      ~YESHE~       *      ~WISDOM~      *      ~ARCHIVE~     *\n*                                                                                 *\n*        Bringing you the teachings of Lama Yeshe and Lama Zopa Rinpoche          *\n***********************************************************************************\n\nThe Lama Yeshe Wisdom Archive (LYWA) is the collected works of Lama Thubten Yeshe and Kyabje Lama Thubten Zopa Rinpoche. The Archive was founded in 1996 by Lama Zopa Rinpoche, its spiritual director, to make available in various ways the teachings it contains. Publication of books of edited teachings for free distribution is one of the ways.\n\nPlease visit www.lamayeshe.com for HEAPS of Dharma material\n\nLama Yeshe and Lama Zopa Rinpoche began teaching at Kopan Monastery, Nepal, in 1970. Since then, their teachings have been recorded and transcribed. At present we have more than 10,000 hours of digital audio and some 60,000 pages of raw transcript on our computers. Many recordings, mostly teachings by Lama Zopa Rinpoche, remain to be transcribed, and as Rinpoche continues to teach, the number of recordings in the Archive increases accordingly. Most of our transcripts have been neither checked nor edited.\n\nThe Lama Yeshe Wisdom Archive is a member of the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition. We are a 501(c)(3) tax-deductible, non-profit corporation dedicated to the welfare of all sentient beings and totally dependent upon your donations for our continued existence.
