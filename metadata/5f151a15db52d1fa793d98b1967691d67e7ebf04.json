Not only is VirtualBox an extremely feature rich, high performance product for enterprise customers, it is also the only professional solution that is freely available as Open Source Software under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). See &quot;About VirtualBox&quot; for an introduction. \n\nPresently, VirtualBox runs on Windows, Linux, Macintosh and OpenSolaris hosts and supports a large number of guest operating systems including but not limited to Windows (NT 4.0, 2000, XP, Server 2003, Vista), DOS/Windows 3.x, Linux (2.4 and 2.6), and OpenBSD.\n\nVirtualBox is being actively developed with frequent releases and has an ever growing list of features, supported guest operating systems and platforms it runs on. VirtualBox is a community effort backed by a dedicated company: everyone is encouraged to contribute while Sun ensures the product always meets professional quality criteria. \n\nSome of the features of VirtualBox are: \n\n* Modularity. VirtualBox has an extremely modular design with well-defined internal programming interfaces and a client/server design. This makes it easy to control it from several interfaces at once: for example, you can start a virtual machine in a typical virtual machine GUI and then control that machine from the command line, or possibly remotely. VirtualBox also comes with a full Software Development Kit: even though it is Open Source Software, you don't have to hack the source to write a new interface for VirtualBox. \n* Virtual machine descriptions in XML. The configuration settings of virtual machines are stored entirely in XML and are independent of the local machines. Virtual machine definitions can therefore easily be ported to other computers. \n* Guest Additions for Windows and Linux. VirtualBox has special software that can be installed inside Windows and Linux virtual machines to improve performance and make integration much more seamless. Among the features provided by these Guest Additions are mouse pointer integration and arbitrary screen solutions (e.g. by resizing the guest window). \n* Shared folders. Like many other virtualization solutions, for easy data exchange between hosts and guests, VirtualBox allows for declaring certain host directories as &quot;shared folders&quot;, which can then be accessed from within virtual machines. \n\nVirtualBox 2.0.6 (released 2008-11-21): \n\n* VMM: ?xed Guru meditation when running 64 bits Windows guests (bug #2220) \n* VMM: ?xed Solaris 10U6 boot hangs (VT-x and AMD-V) bug #2220) \n* VMM: ?xed Solaris 10U6 reboot hangs (AMD-V only; bug #2220) \n* GUI: the host key was sometimes not properly displayed (Windows hosts only, bug #1996) \n* GUI: the keyboard focus was lost after minimizing and restoring the VM window via the Windows taskbar (bugs #784) \n* VBoxManage: properly show SATA disks when showing the VM information (bug #2624) \n* SATA: ?xed access if the buffer size is not sector-aligned (bug #2024) \n* SATA: improved performance \n* SATA: ?xed snapshot function with ports&gt;1 (bug #2510) \n* E1000: ?xed crash under rare circumstances \n* USB: ?xed support for iPhone and Nokia devices (Linux host: bugs #470 &amp; #491) \n* Windows host installer: added proper handling of open VirtualBox applications when updating the installation \n* Windows host installer: ?xed default installation directory on 64-bit on new installations \n* Windows host installer: added proper handling of open VirtualBox applications when updating the installation \n* Linux/Solaris/Darwin hosts: verify permissions in /tmp/vbox-$USER-ipc \n* Linux hosts: ?xed assertion on high network load (AMD64 hosts, ?x for Linux distributions with glibc 2.6 and newer (bug #616) \n* Linux hosts: donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t crash during shutdown with serial ports connected to a host device \n* Solaris hosts: ?xed incompatibility between IPSEC and host interface networking \n* Solaris hosts: ?xed a rare race condition while powering off VMs with host interface networking \n* Solaris hosts: ?xed VBoxSDL on Solaris 10 by shipping the required SDL library (bug #2475) \n* Windows additions: ?xed logged in users reporting via guest properties when using native RDP connections \n* Windows additions: ?xed Vista crashes when accessing shared folders under certain circumstances (bug #2461) \n* Windows additions: ?xed shared folders access with MS-Of?ce (bug #2591) \n* Linux additions: ?xed compilation of vboxvfs.ko for 64-bit guests (bug #2550) \n* SDK: added JAX-WS port caching to speedup connections ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f151a15db52d1fa793d98b1967691d67e7ebf04","amp;dn":"VirtualBox+2.0.6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f151a15db52d1fa793d98b1967691d67e7ebf04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,21,26,21,219,82,209,250,121,61,152,177,150,118,145,214,126,126,191,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
