There are also a few bug fixes, such as making a few weapon criticals more appropriate, and always giving an ear when killing legionaries. In addition, many cute but totally inconsequential things have been added to the game, such as the fact that ravens now look for bodies, NPCs put on nightwear before sleeping, and many new notes are found in mailboxes.\n\nHowever, there are are a few significant changes in EGP that could be regarded as unbalancing, especially if you're not expecting them:\nSkill books can now often be purchased from vendors at a base cost of 50 caps, making them far from rare any more.\nHoly Frag Grenades can be found in loot.\nSniper Rifles have had their damage restored to old value of 62, which is 50% more than the latest official game patch value of 42.\nBoone has been made significantly more deadly.\nCompanion NPCs now level at 1.0X player level, not 0.75 as in last official patch, and some have had stat boosts.\nRex has been made significantly less dangerous, almost to the point of uselessness.\nBinoculars now have Rex's 'Search and Mark' park built in.\nChinese Stealth Armor now has a full stealth field effect, like in FO3.\nStun grenades cause paralysis.\n\nBecause of the breadth of changes made by this mod, it should be regarded as an 'overhaul' mod, and positioned in your load order either quite late (if you want all its changes to override other mods) or quite early (if you want you other mods, especially other overhauls such as FOOK, to take precedence).\n\nFor those who have the time and skill, I think the best solution is to use Wyre Flash to create a Bashed Patch to merge this mod with others, and then to use FNVEdit to tweak any specific fatures that you do or don't want in your game.\n\nList of changes, by category\n----------------------------\n* Items marked with * remove features installed by last official FNV patch.\n\nIngestibles\nBeer (all varieties) adds
