The film is based on a story by John Lemont and stars Herbert Lom, John Gregson, Sean Connery, Alfred Marks and Yvonne Romain. \nOur overall rating for The Frightened City is: good,it offers a great deal of entertainment value - not a masterpiece but still well worth watching. \n\nThe Frightened City is a conventional but brisk gangster yarn. Accent of the film is tough and hard-hitting and concerns intergang warfare plus the clash between the cops and the crooks, the cops, as a spokesman bitterly says, finding themselves hampered by outdated laws. Ã¢â‚¬ËœWeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re trying to fight 20th-century crime with 19th-century legislation.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢\n\nSix main gangs are running the protection racket and a bent accountant hits on the idea of organizing the gangs into one all-powerful syndicate. All goes well for awhile but then the boss of the organization makes a successful play for a deal involving a $560,000 block of offices being built. One of the gangsters fights shy of this bigger game, backs out of the organization and re-forms his own gang. This sparks off gang warfare.\n\nHerbert Lom plays the brains of the crooked organization with urbane villainy and equally reliable John Gregson makes a solid, confident job of the dedicated cop. Alfred Marks is cast offbeat as LomÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gangster lieutenant. Marks gives a rich, oily, sinister and yet often amusing portrayal of an ambitious thug who is prepared to turn killer to get his own way.\n\nComparative newcomer, rugged Sean Connery makes a distinct impression as an Irish crook, with an eye for the ladies. Connery combines toughness, charm and Irish blarney.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 1.40gb\nDuration.... 01:33:53\nCodec.... divx\nFrame Width..... 1016\nFrame Height.... 572\nData Rate.... 2016kbps\nFrame Rate.... 23F/S\nAUDIO\nBit Rate.... 128kbps....
