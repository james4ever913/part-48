There is the government - a system which runs the country, then there are wealth creators like industrialists etc. and then there are politicians in the ruling party and the opposition.\n\nIMDb Rating : 7.5/10 (305 votes) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1451797/\n\nVideo Bitrate..: 1030 kbps \nAudio Bitrate..: 448 kbps AC3 5.1 ch\nAspect Ratio...: 2.235:1\nResolution.....: 608 x 272\nFrame Rate.....: 25.000 fps\nRuntime........: 132 mins\n\nAudio Language.: Hindi\nSubtitles......: English (SRT)\n\nVoMiT NOTES\nPrevious release used a watermarked dvd, the watermark is not from dvd authoring company but rather the vendor/shop. The bollywood market sadly watermarks the dvd's they sell due to piracy, Moserbaer being one of them\n\nPrevious source was film hence their rip went to 23,976 (02:17:17), ours went to 25 fps (02:11:11), hence the difference in playback speed and runtime, no scenes are skipped. We have included a sample from our dvd as well and also comparative samples\n\nNote : Variable crop throughout the dvd, we did not overcrop.\n\nEnjoy are non-watermarked retail dvd ;)\n\ncredit VoMiT &amp; to all the people who made it possible for me to share this with everyone\n\nUPLOAD DEDICATED TO redchaos2354, Motley Crue, jdpennington, BADASS, W1ck3d1nt3ntz, ceo54, DaRkReAlM, ghostman, karakurachow, megaplay, Emery1337x, SaM, geordieboy1979, timamirrockdude, Noir, Shedevil, bone111, JorgeMontana &amp; many, many more &amp; to all the awesome people who are sharing (ALL THE UPLOADERS, THE RIPPERS, THE SCENE GROUPS, ETC, THE WHOLE P2P COMMUNITY)***wish i could list everyone***Thank you very much everyone &amp; i mean EVERYONE!!!\n\n*****help what we can with haiti...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d404e6723a0964b144405879ff1bb81d99bed1b","amp;dn":"Rann.2010.PROPER.DVDRip.XviD-VoMiT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d404e6723a0964b144405879ff1bb81d99bed1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,64,78,103,35,160,150,75,20,68,5,135,159,241,187,129,217,155,237,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
