Candy stars as Harry Crumb, a bumbling detective who comes from a line of great detectives. In his investigations, he uses a great many disguises (much like Chevy Chase in &quot;Fletch&quot;). Crumb is totally clueless, and Candy really takes a funny script and makes it even more funny. The movie doesn&amp;#039;t take itself too seriously, and neither should the viewer. Great Movie. Will be converting more of my John Candy selection soon. Enjoy !!!!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce5368805634f84a3cda90e49aec0b43500970e0","amp;dn":"Who%5C%27s.Harry.Crumb%5B1989%5DDvdRip.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce5368805634f84a3cda90e49aec0b43500970e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,83,104,128,86,52,248,74,60,218,144,228,154,236,11,67,80,9,112,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
