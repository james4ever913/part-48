Multiplayer matches provide rewards of points (in-game currency) and experience, with bonuses for the winning team or players, and additional bonuses based on game length. Mission rewards are randomized, and may sometimes include additional items.\n\nMobile suits can be obtained via rental, random purchase through capsules (hence the title), and through mixing. Mixing requires the purchase of a Mixing Plan, a fully upgraded &quot;key&quot; mobile suit, and a number of specific component suits that get discarded during mixing.\n\nThe strength of a mobile suit is described by its rank. C ranks are the weakest and most common, having four lives in multiplayer games. B ranks have three lives, but are more difficult to obtain. A ranks are even stronger, but have only two lives. S ranks have 2 lives and are currently the strongest units in the game and can be bought with real currency or there mix plans can be bought with points. Some mobile suits have rare CR, BR, and AR variants, which can only be capsuled, and have different weapons or abilities. Additionally, there are CS, BS, and AS mobile suits, which are similar, but can only be acquired through mixing.\n\nMobile suits are further categorized into rock, paper, and scissor types, with a self-explanatory relationship. Rocks are traditionally oriented toward hand-to-hand combat, whereas papers are long-range, and scissors are multi-role.\n\nThere is a high degree of customization available in the game. The player can purchase paint sets and stickers to change the appearance of mobile suits, and tweak their stats slightly. Especially rare items, such as red paint, extra storage, operators, and room themes, however, are unattainable with in-game currency, and can only be purchased with Chinese money.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f93e9c8574266c8ca2efc2344ba89cc88a7afaa2","amp;dn":"SD+Gundam+Capsule+Fighter+Online+-+Taiwan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f93e9c8574266c8ca2efc2344ba89cc88a7afaa2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,62,156,133,116,38,108,140,162,239,194,52,75,168,156,200,138,122,250,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
