The basic premise is that losing Coach Archer (John Amos) and his inept assistant Milo (Tim Conway) are about to be fired - and so they run away to the continent of Africa, where they find the WorldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Greatest Athlete of the title, Nanu (Jan Michael-Vincent), whom they whisk back to America, where he turns the failing athletic program of the college into a success.  However, NanuÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s witch doctor godfather (played wonderfully by Roscoe Lee Browne) is unsure of Coach ArcherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s intentions and follows to rescue Nanu, leading to a wonderfully hilarious scene where Tim Conway is shrunken down to one inch tall, and trying to warn Archer and Nanu.\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a very funny film, with the requisite romance between Nanu and the girl he meets and falls in love withÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Jane.  I truly love the ending, when Coach Archer and Milo take another tripÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to China.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e8b7126d5caa6c3f09d04dd8b2f4354615bd4da","amp;dn":"The+World%5C%27s+Greatest+Athlete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e8b7126d5caa6c3f09d04dd8b2f4354615bd4da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,139,113,38,213,202,166,195,240,157,4,221,139,47,67,84,97,91,212,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
