EDWARD GRIFFIN, Author/Producer; EDWIN VIEIRA, Author/Constitutional Attorney and TED BAEHR, Founder of MovieGuide and Christian Film &amp; TV Commission.\n\nUnfortunately, influences, such as Cultural Marxism and Corporate Fascism, have influenced the Democratic and Republican parties so much, the Founders' original intent has been seriously compromised. As a result, the republic guaranteed by the Constitution has wandered down a road towards insolvency, immorality and totalitarianism, as F.A. Hayek might say. ORIGINAL INTENT explores how this has happened and offers solutions that Americans, no matter what party affiliation, can apply to restore a nation of values, general welfare, and leadership by example.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9001d2fd0e27b2e7a1b956b5c15f01a9f8a831d0","amp;dn":"Original+Intent+%28Full+Documentary%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9001d2fd0e27b2e7a1b956b5c15f01a9f8a831d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,1,210,253,14,39,178,231,161,185,86,181,193,95,1,169,248,168,49,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
