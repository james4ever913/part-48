The End of DaysÃƒÂ seen through the eyes of an ex-cop who has lost everythingÃƒÂ wife, daughter, and faith.\n\n\nOriginal film name: End of Days.\nNew film name: Jericho Cane.\nFilm studio name: Universal.\nEdit crew name: Uncanny Antman.\nDate Original Film Was Released: 1999\nDate Edit Was Released: July 2008\nOriginal Runtime: 2h2m\nNew Runtime: 1h30m\n\nYour intention for this fan edit: Apart from just simply wanting to tighten up the pacing, I felt that the story worked more effectively when revealed via JerichoÃƒâ€ s experiences. Rather than have the entire back-story spelled out to us in the first ten minutes, we learn what is going on as Jericho learns it. I also wanted to heighten the focus on JerichoÃƒâ€ s spiritual journey, such as it is. Also, by removing the early Cult scenes, the film deceptively starts off as a more typical Arnold Schwarzenegger action film, only to transform into a supernatural thriller as we progress.\n\nYour way to achieve your intention: Primarily, the removal of any early scenes featuring Christine, including her birth. We do not meet her until Jericho does. The subsequent exposition fills in all the details that we need.\n\nCuts removed/added/extended:\n\n* Numerous snips and alterations, some of the more noticeable changes beingÃƒÂ \n* Removed the early scenes involving the Cult.\n* Removed The Albino.\n* Moved the scene of ÃƒÂ´The ManÃƒÂ¶ being possessed to later in the film so that when Jericho is protecting him at the beginning, he is still just a regular guy. Why would Satan need to hire Schwarzenegger as a bodyguard? At one point, Father Kovack mentions that the ÃƒÂ´manÃƒÂ¶ (the person that Satan was to inhabit) was destined, just as Christine wasÃƒÂ so the theory stands that Thomas Aquinas was trying to kill the vessel before he was taken over. Otherwise, whatÃƒâ€ s with thinking he could just stop Satan with a bullet?\n* Trimmed the possession sequence, specifically removing the transparent ÃƒÂ´CreatureÃƒÂ¶ skating around town.\n* Removed the insultingly stupid fake scare of the cat in the refrigerator.\n* Removed all scenes involving Christine up until Jericho and Chicago locate her.\n* Removed most of the moments of supposed levity involving The Man. (The bus hitting the kid, ÃƒÂ´DonÃƒâ€ t fuck up the coat.ÃƒÂ¶ et cetera.)\n* Removed The Man pissing oil, or whatever that crap is. WeÃƒâ€ ve already seen him blow up a restaurant at will, so why the need for this ridiculousness? Also removed shots of Chicago either in or next to van before explosionÃƒÂ when he shows up at JerichoÃƒâ€ s apartment later, it should be believable that he survived. Which it is not in the theatrical cut.\n* Removed Mabel beating the shit out of Jericho. I mean what the hell? ÃƒÂ is she supposed to be a demon or something? If she is, itÃƒâ€ s oddly out of context with the rest of the film. And if she isnÃƒâ€ t, whatÃƒâ€ s the deal with her claws and Arnie-bashing abilities?\n* Removed The Man showing off the healing of his wounds to Jericho. If he can do that, why does his body become so damaged later on?\n* Removed some fire stunt shots with a less-than-convincing mask, and the shot where Jericho and Christine outrun an explosion.\n* Removed the phony countdown drama during the climax. How exactly is Satan supposed to impregnate Christine in the three seconds before the so-called Millennium is over? By making it so that there is still plenty of time to ÃƒÂ´do the deedÃƒÂ¶, it makes JerichoÃƒâ€ s sacrifice actually mean something, as itÃƒâ€ s truly his only way to stop the End of Days.\n* Also trimmed, cropped, flipped, and altered a bunch of continuity errors. I never noticed before how many this film has. I have, however, left in a lot of the ÃƒÂ´Action Arnold clichÃƒÅ¡sÃƒÂ¶ The film literally progresses due to a parade of clichÃƒÅ¡s, coincidences, and just plain luck. (Not to mention, several intentional plotholes.) To remove them would (in my opinion) destroy any semblence of an actual storyline.\n\nFan edit details (please add here details about DVD contents as well as video and audio information): Anamorphic, and 5.1 audio.
