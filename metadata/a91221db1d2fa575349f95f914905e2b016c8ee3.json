Unfortunately people are still releasing it with very poor subtitles even though it's been out for over a year.\n\nThese are GOOD subtitles!\n\nThey can be used as a direct replacement for the poor quality subtitles in this torrent, just delete the existing .idx, .sub and .srt files then replace them with this .srt file.  This new srt file should be renamed &quot;ssf-cho-xvid.srt&quot; (the same names as the movie file) so your movie player will detect it automatically:\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4702744/Chocolate_(2009)_DvDrip.Avi_(Thai_with_English_subs)\n\nUpdate:  I just found out there are three or four different versions of this movie being released in Britain and US, some 88 minutes, some 90 minutes, some 92 minutes.  These subtitles are for the original Thai release DVD of length 1 hour 28 minutes 44 seconds.  Other releases probably have edited, cut or added footage, so they may not sync well, but with the know-how you can to use these good subtitles as a basis for fixing up whatever is supplied with those other rips.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a91221db1d2fa575349f95f914905e2b016c8ee3","amp;dn":"Chocolate+%282008+Thai+Action%29+English+Subtitles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a91221db1d2fa575349f95f914905e2b016c8ee3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,18,33,219,29,47,165,117,52,159,149,249,20,144,94,43,1,108,142,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
