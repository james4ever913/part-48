GOT MY MOJO WORKINÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢:   After a long day of recording at around 2am we were kicking around chatting about Philmont (of course).  Mike had a guitar he was doodling with.  Voss had a harmonica.  I moved the microphones to where they were sitting asked them to record something.  This is what came out. -Larry                                            \n  Voss: Vocals, Harp Mike: Guitar\n\n\n2.    JOHNNY 99:  We really wanted to put this one on the album because itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a great story song and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s from the same Bruce Springsteen album (Nebraska) as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œReason To BelieveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.  In the end, we figured the content didn't really fit the rest of the album.  A great song.  \n100% Voss.  \n- Larry\n\n\n3.  LONG BLACK VEIL: This song should have been on the album but we felt we couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get the right sound. \n - Larry                                                                        Andy: Vocals &amp; Guitar, Ellie: Fiddle, Mike: Bass\n\n\n4.    CLUCK OLÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ HEN: This was the first song we played for this session to test out the mikes.  We didn't get the best sound, but I LOVE what Iron John brings to this song.  Old-time fiddle and I really like his singing style. \n- Larry\n\nIron John: Vocals &amp; Fiddle,\n\nAndy: Guitar, Mike: Banjo, Tim: Mandolin\n\n\n5.    CATS IN THE CRADLE: I used to play this along with my staff at campfires.  It had a lot of impact on the advisors.  But more so itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a song about regret.  Time wasted.  Sometimes people might regret time wasted at Philmont.  We just didn't need another ballad on the CD, especially one with me singing- and besides itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s been done so well by so many people already.  - Larry\n\nLarry: Vocals, Mike: Guitar, Andy: Bass\n\n\n6.  land of the navajo - tobasco donkeys.mp3  A great story song and Andy played this for several years while he was out there.  We just couldn't find the right sound.   - Larry\n\nAndy: Vocals &amp; Guitar, Ellie: Fiddle, Tim: Mandolin, Mike: Bass\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b348c8e8d3a80586917c7d715f5c46dba562b56a","amp;dn":"Tobasco+Donkeys+-+Free+Songs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b348c8e8d3a80586917c7d715f5c46dba562b56a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,72,200,232,211,168,5,134,145,124,125,113,95,92,70,219,165,98,181,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
