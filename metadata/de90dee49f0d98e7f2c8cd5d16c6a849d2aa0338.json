Among \ndog lovers, she&amp;#039;s a legend for the risks she&amp;#039;ll take to save an animal from \nabuse. Among her friends, Amy&amp;#039;s heedless devotion is often cause for \nconcern. To widower Brian McCarthy, whose commitment she can&amp;#039;t allow \nherself to return, Amy&amp;#039;s behavior is far more puzzling and hides a shattering \nsecret.\n\nNo one is surprised when Amy risks her life to save Nickie, nor when she \ntakes the female golden into her home. The bond between Amy and Nickie is \nimmediate and uncanny. Even her two other goldens, Fred and Ethel, \nrecognize Nickie as special, a natural alpha. But the instant joy Nickie brings is \nshadowed by a series of eerie incidents. An ominous stranger. A mysterious \nhome invasion.\n\nAnd the unmistakable sense that someone is watching Amy&amp;#039;s every move and \nthat, whoever it is, he&amp;#039;s not alone. Someone has come back to turn Amy into \nthe desperate, hunted creature she&amp;#039;s always been there to save. But now \nthere&amp;#039;s no one to save Amy and those she loves. From the breathtaking \nopening scene to its shocking climax, The Darkest Evening of the Year is Dean \nKoontz at his finest, a transcendent thriller certain to have listeners \ncaptivated until dawn.\n\n----\n\nDean Koontz, the author of many #1 New York Times bestsellers, lives with \nhis wife, Gerda, and the enduring spirit of their golden retriever, Trixie, in \nsouthern California.\n\n----\n\nKirsten Kairos is a voice-over artist and singer who has toured worldwide and \nrecorded  with a number of artists including Julio Iglesias and David Lee Roth. \nHer voice can be heard on numerous radio and television commercials as well \nas character voices for animation.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de90dee49f0d98e7f2c8cd5d16c6a849d2aa0338","amp;dn":"Dean+Koontz+-+The+Darkest+Evening+Of+The+Year","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de90dee49f0d98e7f2c8cd5d16c6a849d2aa0338","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,144,222,228,159,13,152,231,242,200,205,93,22,198,168,73,210,170,3,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
