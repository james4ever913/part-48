His research has taken him into some far-out realms of geoengineering -- dramatic, cheap, sometimes shocking solutions to a warming atmosphere, such as blowing a Mt. Pinatubo-size cloud of sulfur into the sky to bring the global temperature down.\n\nHis other areas of study include the capture and storage of CO2 , the economics and climatic impacts of large-scale wind power , and the use of hydrogen as a transportation fuel. Another interest: How we make decisions when we don't have reliable scholarly data.\n\nHe teaches at the University of Calgary, and was named Environmental Scientist of the Year by Canadian Geographic in 2006.\n\n \n\n    &quot;[Keith is] an original thinker in the field of climate science and one of the world's most accomplished energy-policy analysts&quot;\n\nCabadian Geographic\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nplease leave a comment if you want, this is just to show what is out there...\nAnd before you go and spam, dl it watch it and make up your own mind...\ncheers the_phyrexian\n\nAre you a British citizen?
