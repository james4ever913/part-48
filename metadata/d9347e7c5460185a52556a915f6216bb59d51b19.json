ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHow Joey Got His Groove BackÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is probably one of there more renowned songs if anyoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ever heard of this band. The contrast to melodic and screaming vocals present equilibrium to the listener and blend in nicely. The screams are powerful and horse and shows a good introduction to the band. The hardcore styled drumming at around the 2 minute mark will make you circle around and get you off your ***. This band is no stranger to breakdown and the palm muted heaviness of the guitars will put you through the walls. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDressed to thrillÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ continues the rampage at a high octane pace. By this now you should be able to see the resemblance of Neal Carters murderous voice to Keith BuckleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s from the Last Night in Town era. The song seems to be split into two with a short pause in between that sometimes even confuses me.
