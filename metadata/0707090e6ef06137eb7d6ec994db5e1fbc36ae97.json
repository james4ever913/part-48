It stars Mia Sorvino, Scott Foley, Victor Garber and Omar Sharif.  Mira Sorvino kicks ass, jousting from the back of a mounted-policeman's steed, overpowering hoodlums and performing various other feats of daring-do.  \n\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s all action - all the time  all in the name of relic-hunting. Following in ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Indiana Jones' and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“The DaVinci Code'sÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ similar footsteps and based on Raymond Khoury's 2005 novel of the same name, The Last Templar teams archaeologist Tess Chaykin (Sorvino) and FBI agent Sean Daley (Foley) as they journey around the world in pursuit of the lost secrets of the legendary medieval Knights Templar. Along the way, there are hidden treasures, ancient instruments, veiled horsemen and treacherous shipwrecks. \n\nThe filming (in Canada, California and Morocco) of this mini-movie got attention because Mia Sorvino did her own stunts. The Oscar-winner not only solved mysteries and kicked ass in the film ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ but she definitely felt the pain. &quot;Five teeth. Five teeth were broken,&quot; Sorvino said about her on-set mishap while filming a violent boat scene. She continued &quot;I ended up doing every single take with the wide and the close and the poor stunt double was standing around all day waiting to do it! ...I would love to do a sequel. That would be my ideal next step.&quot;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0707090e6ef06137eb7d6ec994db5e1fbc36ae97","amp;dn":"The+Last+Templar+%282009%29+HDTV.Avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0707090e6ef06137eb7d6ec994db5e1fbc36ae97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,7,9,14,110,240,97,55,235,125,110,201,148,219,94,31,188,54,174,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
