Nowhere near as good as the 'Toad's Place' DVD (which was pro-shot) but still very nice. It's the complete show from the August 28, 1991 show from Koln, Germany. The taper was in the middle of a busy crowd but managed to shoot between all the heads and hands in front of him. Well at least most of the time. There are moments that the screen shows black video but that's because the crowd was blocking the camera. The audio is also very decent and clear. And the show itself is major fun!\n\nRun time: 121 minutes\nPAL DVD\nStereo Sound\nChapters: Yes for each song\nCover: created and included\n\nSet List:\nSETLIST:\n \n01 Out of the Frying Pan\n02 Masculine\n03 You Took the Words\n04 Midnight at the Lost and Found\n05 All Revved Up\n06 Talk to the Audience\n07 Two Out of Three\n08 Bat Out of Hell\n09 Introductions\n10 Paradise by the Dashboard Light\n11 Rock Medley","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7bc4321dd0870f3c087f37a7fade9e61af2b1b88","amp;dn":"Meat+Loaf+Live+in+Koln+1991+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7bc4321dd0870f3c087f37a7fade9e61af2b1b88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,196,50,29,208,135,15,60,8,127,55,167,250,222,158,97,175,43,27,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
