Mixing of the highest standard and an excellent 2CD compilation. This club is different from any other on the White Isle and caters very much for the European clubber rather than target one specific market. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3f56c89cd33f4b866db45087798825b55e7a394","amp;dn":"El+Divino+Live+08-Closing+Party%28Atomic+RG%29Orangeman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3f56c89cd33f4b866db45087798825b55e7a394","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,245,108,137,205,51,244,184,102,219,69,8,119,152,130,91,85,231,163,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
