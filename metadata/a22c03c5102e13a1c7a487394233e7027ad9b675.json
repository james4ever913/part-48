Collectively their mission was to create the lost 60's girl group record of their dreams, and yours. With a little help from Mark Ronson, Alex Greenwald, and the soul and studio sophistication of Dap-Kings Tommy Brenneck and Homer Steinweiss, The Like have happened upon a sure classic. After years on the road with the likes of Arctic Monkeys, Kings Of Leon and Muse, they're finally back with Release Me. It's a record about being heartbroken and breaking hearts, years of feverish living, harebrained schemes, and raving-mad relationships, testing boundaries and breaking them all down. In short, it's about growing up!
