I&amp;#039;ve been caning this for over a month now, and it&amp;#039;s still going very strong for me.\n\nExcellent dirty electro with a melodic twist...\n\n\n\nThere is no discogs entry for this release as yet.\n\n\n\nfRew &amp; Shopliftas - Bermuda Nights [6:48]\n\n\n15.5MB\n\n320KBps.\n\n\n\nFor those who may be unaware, both fRew and Shopliftas are names that I will be paying much attention to this coming new year, and they are both names related heavily with Electro Clash and Dirty Electro.\n\nCertainly, all it took for fRew to shake me around and grab my unwavering attention was his / their recent remix of Bass Kleph&amp;#039;s &quot;Bump Uglies&quot;... and what an absolutely fantastic job it is.\n\n\nBass Kleph, fRew and Shopliftas are all excellent artists on the new up and coming Vacation Records label who have launched with a bang in 2007.  I will be paying much attention as they go along.\n\n\nYou can find out more about Vacation Records, here:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.vacationrecords.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.vacationrecords.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nIf anyone from or related to their outfit comes across this post, please be aware, that your discogs entry for the label needs sprucing up... there is no reference to your website nor your contact details listed on the page which I highly recommend for public relations purposes.\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and please seed.\n\n\nthemagicke\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/themagicke&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/themagicke&lt;/a&gt;\n                                                        &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.darksiderg.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.darksiderg.com/&lt;/a&gt;\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d337ab5f9531b1763bf4d6849ca0277e7508721a","amp;dn":"fRew+%26+Shopliftas+-+Bermuda+Nights+2007+%5BElectro+House+%2F+Clash%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d337ab5f9531b1763bf4d6849ca0277e7508721a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,55,171,95,149,49,177,118,59,244,214,132,156,160,39,126,117,8,114,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
