A collection of the six issues were later released in 1990, along with a final extended issue in 1991.The comic depicts a futuristic Earth rife with extraterrestrials, pollution, crime and corruption. The focus of the stories are ElÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Ape and Deadbeat Sleeze, two private eye brothers, who ply their trade in the seedy underbelly of The Big Apple, a futuristic city taking itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s name from the nickname of New York City.\n\nIn the comics Deadbeat and ElÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Ape Sleeze are described as dysfunctional orphans who grew up in an orphanage for unwanted ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œboil in the bagÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ test tube babies. As adults they use amoral and often underhanded methods to get the results demanded by their insalubrious and eclectic clients.\n\nThe title characters in the Sleeze Brothers comics were loosely inspired by Jake and Elwood Blues from the cult movie The Blues Brothers, but were actually based on Andy LanningÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s two cousins, Phil and Pete Carmichael. These two characters appeared on the front cover of the collected edition. However, other influences also shine through, specifically Ridley ScottÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hugely popular movie Blade Runner.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a78deb6b243dbabfe0a1b3657412ed5901cd7cb4","amp;dn":"The+Sleeze+Brothers+03","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a78deb6b243dbabfe0a1b3657412ed5901cd7cb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,141,235,107,36,61,186,191,224,161,179,101,116,18,237,89,1,205,124,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
