Seven series were originally broadcast on BBC One in the United Kingdom between 1981 and 1991, with sporadic Christmas specials until 2003. Episodes are regularly repeated on GOLD.\n\nSet in Peckham in south London, it stars David Jason as ambitious market trader Derek \\\\\\&quot;Del Boy\\\\\\&quot; Trotter, Nicholas Lyndhurst as his younger brother Rodney, and Lennard Pearce as their aging grandfather (later replaced by Buster Merryfield as their Uncle Albert). Backed by a strong supporting cast, the series chronicles their highs and lows in life, in particular their attempts to get rich.\n\nList of Episodes:\n\n-Big Brother\n-Go West Young Man\n-Cash And Curry\n\nSCREENS:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/1787/pdvd000xu.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/1787/pdvd000xu.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img143.imageshack.us/img143/5008/bscap0004la.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img143.imageshack.us/img143/5008/bscap0004la.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/2531/bscap0007k.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/2531/bscap0007k.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img573.imageshack.us/img573/9533/bscap0010a.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img573.imageshack.us/img573/9533/bscap0010a.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ec35fd13d5955460f0a53c0772980f8f297dff9","amp;dn":"ONLY+FOOLS+AND+HORSES+-+Disc+1+%28RETAIL+DVD%29+by+ANTiC+GROUP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ec35fd13d5955460f0a53c0772980f8f297dff9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,195,95,209,61,89,85,70,15,10,83,192,119,41,128,248,242,151,223,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
