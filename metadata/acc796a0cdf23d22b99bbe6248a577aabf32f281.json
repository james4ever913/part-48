Since then he has been hailed as a pioneer, with his revolutionary experiments in ambient music and audio visual art and as featured producer on benchmark albums by David Bowie, Talking Heads, U2 and Coldplay.\n\nEno has given Arena unprecedented access to observe him working in his studio and talking with friends and colleagues. The master of reinvention engages with fellow influential minds, including Richard Dawkins, Malcolm Gladwell, David Whittaker and Steve Lillywhite, in a series of conversations on science, art, systems analysis, producing and cybernetics.\n\n\n\n\nFile Name .............: Arena - Brian Eno - Another Green World (22 January 2010)[PDTV(XviD)].avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ..: 489,633,792 bytes\nRuntime (# of frames) .: 58:47.720 (88193 frames)\n\nVideo Codec ...........: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nframe Size ............: 624x352 [=1.773]\nFPS ...................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate .........: 966 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ........: 0.176 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC ......: [B-VOP]...[]...[]...[]\n\nAudio Codec ...........: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...........: 48000 Hz\nAudio bitrate .........: 131 kb/s [2 channel(s)] VBR audio\nInterleave ............: 40 ms\n\n---\n\nBrian Eno - Hits, Classics and Tracks\nBBC4 - 22 January 2010\n\nThe music Brian Eno has been involved in making ranges from the experimental to the massively popular.
