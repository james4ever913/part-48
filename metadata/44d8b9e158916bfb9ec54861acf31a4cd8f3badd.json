Chrissy enters the bathroom to find a man (Jack Tripper) sleeping in the tub so she he runs and gets Janet. Jack&amp;#039;s startled awake to discover he&amp;#039;s soaking wet,while Janet holds a plunger out like a gun,asking &quot;Who are you?&quot; (in her short lived New York accent). Jack introduces himself and tells them he was one of the party crashers. They get Jack out of the bathroom and offer to dry his clothes in the oven and let him wear one of their frilly robes until later. Chrissy gets the idea to have jack move in because he lives at the YMCA and a man would be great protection for them. After initial reluctance,Janet goes for the idea. Meanwhile landlord Stanley Roper is awake downstairs and still bothered about all the noise from the party last night.He goes up to complain and finds Jack there,he then runs to get his wife Helen,who doesn&amp;#039;t believe him but she goes just the same. Stanley (more than Helen)does not approve of the idea of Jack living with two girls. Jack goes with Chrissy to the kitchen for his clothes and offers to leave so they don&amp;#039;t get in trouble. When they come back out in the living room,Stanley and Helen have suddenly changed their minds. Jack asks Janet how she talked them into it and after short explanation gives him the upshot,&quot;Oh,I also told him that you were gay!&quot; ...and so it started.\n\nEpisode 1: A Man About the House\nEpisode 2: And Mother Makes Four\nEpisode 3: Roper&amp;#039;s Niece\nEpisode 4: No Children, No Pets\nEpisode 5: Jack the Giant Killer\nEpisode 6: It&amp;#039;s Only Money\n\nRating:G\n\nRuntime:146 Minutes two hours 26 minutes\n\nLabel: Anchor Bay\n\nStudio: Starz / Anchor Bay\n\nRelease Date: 2003-11-11\n\nDVD Format: Keep Case, Academy , 1.33:1, Closed Captioned, Color, Sides:1 \n\nDVD Features: Audio Track 1: English, Unknown\n\nJohn Ritter ...
