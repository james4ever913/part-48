Brittany Murphy is impressive in seamless performance.\n\nPersonal note @addictedtomovies: Thank you for pointing me to this great, funny,\nentertaining and smart movie. Brittany's best role I've seen(equally mesmerizing as in Don't Say a Word). \nThanks again.\nAt the beginning was the quote from Shakespeare's &quot;The Tempest&quot;:\n&quot;Hell is empty. All the devils are here.&quot;\n\nNote to all: It was hard-to-get one... and considering what was the input, I am satisfied with A8/V8. It is re-encoded old XviD copy of mediocre quality.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4199e788505a0b2c4d7205e1d79dc3295856c174","amp;dn":"Little.Black.Book.2004.H264.%5BREQ%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4199e788505a0b2c4d7205e1d79dc3295856c174","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,153,231,136,80,90,11,44,77,114,5,225,215,157,195,41,88,86,193,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
