A shrewd diplomat and an indomitable force, Mother Teresa is unwilling to accept what others deem impossible, fearlessly fighting for the unloved and the forgotten. Her good works transcend hardships and ultimately earn her international acclaim, including the Nobel Peace prize. The small miracles and humble triumphs of Mother Teresa will inspire you in this poignant tale of a modern-day saint.\n\n'The most spiritually uplifting film since The Passion of the Christ.'\n-Phil Boatwright, The Movie Reporter\n\n-Praised and approved by the Missionaries of Charity and their leader, Sister Nirmala, Mother Teresa's successor.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8132498247d18c5213ad6dcd6d231cb5aa2215ef","amp;dn":"Mother+Teresa+-+New+movie-+Fuki206","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8132498247d18c5213ad6dcd6d231cb5aa2215ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,50,73,130,71,209,140,82,19,173,109,205,109,35,28,181,170,34,21,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
