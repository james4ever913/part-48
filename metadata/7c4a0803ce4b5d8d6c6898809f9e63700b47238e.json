It's like Serial Box, which has SN's, cracks and patches. It would be best to have both of these collections, as this Pack often has serials you cannot find in the SBox.\nUnlike SBox, no readers are required. Just open the dmg file, drag and drop the app where you like.\nHowever, there is no way to view what serials, cracks and patches are new in this issue as compared to the previous.\n\nNOTE:\nThe KCNcrew is concerned about distribution of unauthorized, modified or malicious material (SNs, [k]racks etc).\nIf you are not getting KCN releases from their original .dmg, then do not open them, use them or distribute them.\nIf you are distributing pieces of KCNcrew's package, and not in its entire .dmg form, then you are breaking the agreement terms of KCNcrew.\nPlease do not force KCN to distribute their wealth to an elite few. We much prefer to keep on sharing with everyone.\nThank you,KCNcrew","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c4a0803ce4b5d8d6c6898809f9e63700b47238e","amp;dn":"KCNcrew+Pack+02-01-09","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c4a0803ce4b5d8d6c6898809f9e63700b47238e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,74,8,3,206,75,93,141,108,104,152,128,159,158,99,112,11,71,35,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
