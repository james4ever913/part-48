Sven might have sounded fine in his homeland, but when he got to Oz he really opened up a lot Ã¢â‚¬â€œ working with some of the key Australian jazz players of the period, most of whom had borrowed some of the grooviest styles from American, European, and Brazilian records of the time! The package features slices from 4 different soundtracks by Sven Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all of them great, and all of them in a sublime mix of jazz, bossa nova, and some of the groovier soundtrack styles of the 60s Ã¢â‚¬â€œ played by musicians who include Don Burrows on flute, John Sangster on vibes, and Col Nolan on organ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ coming together in sounds that are weird, watery, but always grooving along in a gentle sort of way. Titles include &quot;Music For Eels&quot;, &quot;Dark World&quot;, and &quot;Sounds Of The Deep&quot; from Inner Space (1974); &quot;Main Theme&quot;, &quot;Desert&quot;, and &quot;Peaceful Landscape&quot; from Nature Walkabout (1965); &quot;In The Wave&quot;, &quot;The Lost City&quot;, and &quot;Bush Fire&quot; from To Ride A White Horse (1966); and &quot;Start Growing Up Now&quot; from The Set (1970) in both vocal and instrumental versions!&quot;\n\n/Dusty Groove","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dce7a0fe3c71195eca87eb066e6c8624186209f8","amp;dn":"Sven+Libaek+-+Inner+Space++The+Lost+Film+Music+of+Sven+Libaek+%28M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dce7a0fe3c71195eca87eb066e6c8624186209f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,231,160,254,60,113,25,94,202,135,235,6,110,108,134,36,24,98,9,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
