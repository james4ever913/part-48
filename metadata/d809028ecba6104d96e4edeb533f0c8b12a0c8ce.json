A tasty shank of old school ska and dancehall, a generous twist of indie (be rude not to rudeboy!) a light splash of reggae, and garnished with a juicy slice of electro pop - voila! these lads whip up a tune as easy as Jamie Oliver making a meal out of the contents of a students fridge - you still with me?\n\nTheir music is said to sound like a stretchy, goo-ey mixture of The SpecialsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦OutkastÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦MadnessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦De La SoulÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦GorillazÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦The Streets and Blur. At a time when musicians take music way too seriously - these boys are gonna put the fun back into listenin to tunes. To understand what KID BRITISH are all about all you have to do is wash yer mouth out an listen up!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d809028ecba6104d96e4edeb533f0c8b12a0c8ce","amp;dn":"Kid+British","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d809028ecba6104d96e4edeb533f0c8b12a0c8ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,9,2,142,203,166,16,77,150,228,237,235,83,63,12,139,18,160,200,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
