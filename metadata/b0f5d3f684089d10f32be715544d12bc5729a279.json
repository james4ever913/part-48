WeSC ha a story to tell, a background to be proud of. And WeSC is surrounded by a lot of interesting peoples, which has a lot of interesting things to say, we call them Weactivists. \nThe very best way to connect to the idea behind WeSC is to watch it on film, to hear other people tell their version of what they think WeSC stands for. That?s what we?ve done with ?The WeSC Calendar?. And since we own all the copyrights to it ? we want to spread it world wide as fast as we can. That?s why we started this collaboration with The Pirate Bay.\nAnd the bittorrent technique makes it possible to reach out with a large amount of information to a massive crowd in no time.\n\n\n\n\n...::::  Info on the files and how to use them  ::::...\n\nXVID\nThese are encoded into the open source codec xvid. \nTo view them on your computer use our favorite tool VLC www.videolan.org which is a nice app that dont need any codecs. It works great on both Windows and Mac OSX. Very user friendly and works with most video files today!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0f5d3f684089d10f32be715544d12bc5729a279","amp;dn":"WeSC.Calendar.DVDRip.XviD-WeSC.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0f5d3f684089d10f32be715544d12bc5729a279","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,245,211,246,132,8,157,16,243,43,231,21,84,77,18,188,87,41,162,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
