It returned to the air on March 18, 2006, in an 8 EST time slot. It was also on ESPN Radio with a start time of 7:35 EST.\n\nAt the time of the original airing it was a rare example of professional wrestling being broadcast on an over-the-air commercial television network after the 1950s. It coincided with and contributed to the apogee of the &quot;second golden age&quot; of professional wrestling in the United States. In a time when weekly programming consisited primarily of established stars dominating enhancement talent, Saturday Night's Main Event was made up entirely of star vs. star bouts.\n\nAfter leaving NBC in 1991, it aired twice on FOX in 1992 before disappearing for over a decade.\n\nWhen WWE's flagship show, Monday Night Raw returned to the USA Network in 2005, Saturday Night's Main Event was revived in 2006 as a &quot;special series&quot; to air on occasion on NBC as part of a deal between WWE and NBC Universal. The Raw, SmackDown!, and ECW brand rosters are now featured on the show.\n\nSaturday Night's Main Event debuted on May 11, 1985 in the late-night time slot normally assigned to reruns of the NBC sketch comedy Saturday Night Live. Then-SNL executive producer Dick Ebersol had made a deal with WWF owner Vince McMahon to produce the show, after Ebersol had seen the high ratings that two WWF specials drew on MTV in 1984ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“85. Although the show aired infrequently, it did, starting in 1986, settle into a predictable pattern of airdates: New Year's weekend, an episode in late February/early March, an episode in late April/early May, an episode in late September/early October, and Thanksgiving weekend. 1989 and 1990 both offered episodes in July promoted as &quot;Summertime Bonus Editions.&quot;\n\nOn February 10, 2009 the WWE released a 3-disc dvd set on the history of Saturday Night's Main Event. The set includes more then 30 full matches and several non-wrestling segments. Among these are highlights of Uncle Elmer's wedding, Hulk Hogan's &quot;Real American&quot; music video, and Mr. Perfect smashing Hogan's WWF Championship belt. The first match in the program's history is included as an extra. Also, four matches from the program's spinoff known as The Main Event are included, two of which that are among the most famous matches in WWE history. The first is the Wrestlemania III rematch between Hogan and AndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© the Giant in February 1988 and the second is the Mega Powers' (Hogan and Randy Savage) match with the Twin Towers (The Big Boss Man and Akeem) in February 1989. Both had direct implications on each year's Wrestlemania. The Hogan-Andre match led to the WWF title being vacated until Wrestlemania IV while the other led to the breakup of the Mega Powers and Hogan defeating Randy Savage to win the WWF title at Wrestlemania V. The third is a Battle Royal that took place in April 1991, and the fourth is a match between Bret Hart and Ted DiBiase that same year.\n\n\nRuntime:8hr 32min\nCountry:USA \nLanguage:English, French \nColor:Color \nAspect Ratio:1.33 : 1 \nDVD5\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff7356ffc246a65c55f8b22811e33a090b811b82","amp;dn":"WWE+The+Best+Of+Saturday+Night%5C%27s+Main+Event+%282009%29+DVD-R++PAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff7356ffc246a65c55f8b22811e33a090b811b82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,115,86,255,194,70,166,92,85,248,178,40,17,227,58,9,11,129,27,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
