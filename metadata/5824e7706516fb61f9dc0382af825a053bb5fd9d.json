For those unfamiiar with the Baltimore Consort:\n\nThe Baltimore Consort is a small ensemble of instrumentalists and singers whose major focus has been early music, taking into account both the classical and folk realms, often blurring the distinction between the two. In the early years, its main focus was English music from the Elizabethan period, but the group soon branched out into Irish, Scottish, French, Spanish, and Italian early music. The chronological range of the repertory has generally fallen into Renaissance era, roughly spanning the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The Consort players perform on early instruments (viols, recorders, lutes, rebec, etc.) and their concerts and recordings can feature only instrumental music or a mixture of vocal and instrumental pieces.\n\nEnjoy and please seed!
