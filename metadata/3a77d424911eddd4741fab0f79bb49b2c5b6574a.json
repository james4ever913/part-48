Desperately he turns to his lawyer friend, Vikram, only to have himself prosecuted at his very hands. Vikram gets sentenced, and upon his release goes to Amit and asks him to negotiate to get him his share of their former business from Rajan. Amit agrees to do so, but the negotiation gets bitter, argument ensues, followed by fisticuffs and use of firearms, which lead to the death of Rajan. It is now Amit\\'s turn to be on the run from the law, as his pleas that he acted in self-defense are ignored, and there is no one to turn to for help. Amit\\'s pregnant wife, Janki, asks him to run away somewhere safe, while she re-locates to another city until his file is closed or set aside. Amit runs to nearby Nepal, while Janki gives birth to twins. Unfortunately, for her the twins and her get separated. She does manage to find Shankar, but there is no trace of Guru. With one son missing, her husband on the run from the law, and having to take care of an infant, how will Janki overcome life\\'s odds on her own? \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a77d424911eddd4741fab0f79bb49b2c5b6574a","amp;dn":"Mahaan+1983-DVD-rip-by-salmanzk.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a77d424911eddd4741fab0f79bb49b2c5b6574a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,119,212,36,145,30,221,212,116,31,171,15,121,187,73,178,197,182,87,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
