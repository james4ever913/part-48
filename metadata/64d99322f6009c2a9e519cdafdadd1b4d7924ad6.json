No one knew who &quot;Sampaothong&quot; was and how he looked like. Everyone just knew that he was a Thai/Chinese writer who was famous in Thailand.\n\nIn fact, &quot;Sampaothong&quot; was Theeradej or Ah-Joo, a youngest son of Ah-Cheng and Meiling, a Chinese couple who imigrated from China to settle in Thailand and earned thier living by opening the food shop selling &quot;Khao Mun Gai&quot; (Steamed-Chicken with Rice) and &quot;Ped Palo&quot; (Stewed Duck). They had 3 sons, Theerachai or Ah-Jo, Theerachart or Ah-Jiw and Theeradej or Ah-Joo.\n\nAh-Cheng always thought that having 3 sons was a gift from God because he thought that the son could carry on his lineage and had more gratefulness than daughter.\n\nHowever, in his mind, Ah-Joo was his hatred child and Ah-Jo and Ah-Jiw were his loved sons because when Ah-Joo was born, his family got a difficulty and had to imigrate to Thailand, so he thought that Ah-Joo was a jinx of his family. So, Ah-Cheng had never cared about his last son and always quarrelled with each other.\n\nAh-Jo got a job in the real estate company and Ah-Jiw got a job in the bank. Ah-Joo loved to be the author, so he decided to wrote the novel for magazines. However, Ah-Joo was glad to know that Ah-Cheng liked to read &quot;Sampaothong&quot;'s novel though his father didn't know he was that author, so he tried to use the novel to communicate with his father's mind.\n\nThe story about Chinese family that had only daughters and had no son to carry on the lineage were the plot that interested Ah-Joo for his new novel that he wanted his father to read. And Ah-Chang's family that had only 3 daughters, Dala, Panan and Tanyong could be his source for his novel, so he decided to apply for a labor job in their &quot;Chang-Sin&quot; Chinese Opera House.\n\nWith Ah-Joo good looking and smart character made Tanyong, a youngest daughter distrusted him. She thought that he was a spy from another Chinese opera house, so she tried to found fault with him and teased him in many ways to drive him out of her family.\n\n--credits to wasashimi.blogspot.com \t\t\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64d99322f6009c2a9e519cdafdadd1b4d7924ad6","amp;dn":"Botan+Kleep+Sood+Tai+-The+End+%5BLakorn+Thai%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64d99322f6009c2a9e519cdafdadd1b4d7924ad6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,217,147,34,246,0,156,42,158,81,156,218,253,173,209,180,215,146,74,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
