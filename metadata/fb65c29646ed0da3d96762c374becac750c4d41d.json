In Thuli Visham too, he played the villain, pitted against Ramasami, who was then a noted hero, especially after the watershed movie Velaikkari (1949).\n\nBased on a play by well known Tamil writer Chandilyan, who specialised in the historical genre, the film was written and directed by A. S. A. Sami, a successful filmmaker of that day. Produced by V. L. Narasu of Narasu Studios, it was a story of kings, queens and manipulating rajagurus. A greedy king (Ranga Rao) usurps the country of another king (Krishnamurthi), who manages to escape. But before fleeing, he leaves his queen (Subbulakshmi) and son in the custody of the kind hearted rajaguru (Narayanasami) who brings up the prince (KRR) without anybody's knowledge. Wanting to get back his kingdom, the wandering king organises a secret army. Meanwhile, the rajaguru takes the young man to the greedy king and with his influence secures him the job of army commander. The princess (Krishnakumari) falls in love with him. The greedy king sends the commander on a mission to find the deposed king and kill him. The commander sets out on the mission, completely unaware that he is on his father's trail.\n\nEnters another king (Sivaji Ganesan) who seeks the princess' love but is rejected. A court dancer (Saraswathi) also falls in love with the hero. After many twists and turns, the villain's plans are foiled.\n\nMeanwhile, the two women consume a small dose of poison (hence the title) given by the rajaguru. The king excuses everybody's follies and gives the deposed king his crown back. The two women wake up, (shades of Romeo and Juliet!) The poison was only a ruse used by the rajaguru to restore happiness in the kingdom.\nA well-woven story, it was tautly narrated by Sami with impressive cinematography by Mastan, one of the finest in south Indian cinema. The music was composed by K. N. Dhandayudhapani Pillai, who also choreographed the dance sequences of Saraswathi and Kerala Sisters. The film was edited by R. Ramamurthi, who later became a successful producer-director in Kannada cinema.\nOne of the highlights of the film is a sequence where Ramasami and Sivaji Ganesan indulge in a wordy duel which runs for nearly 20 minutes.\nNarayanasami (S. S. Rajendran's brother-in-law), a popular figure in Tamil theatre, gives a beautiful, understated performance.\nThere were many songs in the movie but none of them became popular.\nIn spite of the presence of Ramasami and Sivaji Ganesan and in spite of the movie having been written by Sami and produced by coffee magnate-turned-film producer V. L. Narasu at his Narasu Studios in Guindy, it did not do well.\nThe later day star-producer Balajee appears in a single scene un-credited, while his name appears in the credits as Ã¢â‚¬ËœProduction Assistant'.\nRemembered for: the well-woven storyline, fine performances by Ramasami, Sivaji Ganesan and Narayanasami and well-choreographed dance sequences.\n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Codec: MPEG-1\nVideo Bitrate: 1149 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 352x288\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec:  MPEG-1 Layer 2\nAudio Bitrate: 224kb/s CBR 44100 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: Tamil\nRunTime: About 2 hour plus\nSubtitles: NONE\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]    \nDuration: About 120-150 mins","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb65c29646ed0da3d96762c374becac750c4d41d","amp;dn":"Thuli+Visham+%281954%29+Tamil+VCD+-+No+Subs+-+Shivaji+Ganesan%2C+Krish","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb65c29646ed0da3d96762c374becac750c4d41d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,101,194,150,70,237,13,163,217,103,98,195,116,190,202,199,80,196,212,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
