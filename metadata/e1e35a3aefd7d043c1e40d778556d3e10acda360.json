'Getting our chance at last of a good old crack at the Boche, eh...?'\nEx-infantryman and reconnaissance officer, author and humorist Patrick Ryan is perhaps best remembered for this acerbically comic novel - first published in 1963 and quickly adapted into a 1967 feature film by Richard Lester, starring Michael Crawford and John Lennon. It is a satirical 'memoir' of the misadventures of the haphazard and notably naÃƒÂ¯ve Lieutenant Ernest Goodbody and his fellow fighting men of Twelve Platoon - Sergeant Transom, Corporals Hink, Globe and Dooley, Private Drogue et al - as they stumble ill-preparedly into the theatres of World War Two.
