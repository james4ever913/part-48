It is a rock band with clear folk and medieval influences, later also with gothic and metal elements added to the mix. With their continuous inclusion of oriental sounds and elements of classical music (noted for instance by the use of the arrangements of the backup vocals) and the use of instruments less frequently seen in metal bands, such as bagpipes, shawm, violin, hurdy-gurdy and lute, the band has acquired the label of medieval metal. They have released 8 studio albums, two live albums and two live DVDs. Their fame is mainly in the German-speaking countries, having played only a handful of concerts outside of their &quot;turf&quot;.\n\nOn July 27th, 2007, It was announced that their new album &quot;Bastard&quot; would be released October 26 via Nuclear Blast Records. The CD was recorded at Horus studio in Hannover, Germany and Lundgaard studio in Denmark.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3fee47a57c462e4f072ddefb3c77da819a752d3","amp;dn":"Subway+to+Sally+-+Bastard+%282007%29+MPR+192+FOR-OINK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3fee47a57c462e4f072ddefb3c77da819a752d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,254,228,122,87,196,98,228,240,114,221,239,179,199,125,168,25,167,82,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
