She is quickly befriended by many students at her new high school, but she is intrigued by the mysterious and aloof Cullen siblings. Bella sits next to Edward Cullen in biology class on her first day of school; he appears to be disgusted by her, much to Bella's confusion. A few days later, Bella is nearly struck by a van in the school parking lot. Edward inexplicably moves from several feet away and stops the vehicle with his hand without any harm to himself or Bella. He later refuses to explain this act to Bella and warns her against befriending him.\n\n::General::\n\nFormat: Matroska\nFile size: 1327.98 MiB\nDuration: 2h 1mn\nOverall bit rate: 1 524 Kbps\nEncoded Date: UTC 2011-02-05 06:45:13\n\n\n\nIMDB Link:  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1099212/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1099212/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGenre: Drama | Fantasy | Romance\nCast:\n\nCode:\n\nKristen Stewart   ...

Back in Forks, Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and Bella discuss the complications of becoming an immortal vampire. At 18 years old, one year older than the age Edward was when he became a vampire, Bella expresses her aversion to the idea of marrying so young, though Edward refuses to turn her until they are married and she's had various human experiences she would otherwise miss. While Charlie Swan (Billy Burke) investigates the disappearance of Riley Biers, Edward suspects his disappearance was caused by the newborn vampires. Furthering his suspicions is the intrusion of Riley into Bella's room.\n\n::General::\n\nComplete name: Twilight Eclipse\nFormat: Matroska\nFile size: 1327.26 MiB\nDuration: 2h 3mn\nOverall bit rate: 1 497 Kbps\nEncoded Date: UTC 2011-02-08 15:17:20\n\nIMDB Link:  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1325004/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1325004/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nGenre: Drama | Fantasy | Romance\n\n::Video Specification::\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264 - core 112 r1867 22bfd31            \nAverage video bitrate:\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 850x368\nSource: Blu-ray\n\n::Audio Specification::\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: %Audio_Bitrate%\nChannel Count: 2 channels\nSample Rate: 44.1 KHz\n\nscreens &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/7979/twilighteclipsemkvsnaps.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img191.imageshack.us/img191/7979/twilighteclipsemkvsnaps.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/7979/twilighteclipsemkvsnaps.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/7979/twilighteclipsemkvsnaps.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nNOTE:\nWe are searching for good encoders.Contact us if you wish to be in our gang!\nIf you like our encodes,keep them alive!
