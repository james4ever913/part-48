Hundreds of art objects formed an exhibit brought directly from the Kremlin Armory Museum in Moscow to the newly opened Florida International Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida. The unprecedented exhibition included glittering icons, golden chalices, pearl-encrusted gospel covers, ornamental crucifixes, rich imperial regalia and ecclesiastical vestments, plus weapons, armor, tapestries, textiles and toys. This book has high-quality color photographs of many of these wonderful items, accompanied by text by the Kremlin curators.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94b376c367e5b4e7ee335bd37edc8aa931749d0c","amp;dn":"Treasures+Of+The+Czars+-+From+The+state+Museum+of+Moscow+Cremlin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94b376c367e5b4e7ee335bd37edc8aa931749d0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,179,118,195,103,229,180,231,238,51,91,211,126,220,138,169,49,116,157,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
