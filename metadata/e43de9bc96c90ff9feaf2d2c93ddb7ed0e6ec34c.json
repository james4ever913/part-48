(30. August 2005) | ISBN 354023909X\n\nIn the global-warming debate, definitive answers to questions about ultimate causes and effects remain elusive. In Global Warming: Myth or Reality? Marcel Leroux seeks to separate fact from fiction in this critical debate from a climatological perspective. Beginning with a review of the dire hypotheses for climate trends, the author describes the history of the 1998 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and many subsequent conferences. He discusses the main conclusions of the three IPCC reports and the predicted impact on global temperatures, rainfall, weather and climate, while highlighting the mounting confusion and sensationalism of reports in the media. After taking a hard look at the reality of the greenhouse effect, the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“evidenceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ from climate models, and the modelsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ limitations, Leroux postulates alternate causes of climate change and analyzes the trends for global temperatures, rainfall patterns, and sea level. He poses the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“hereticalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ question if warming may be considered a benefit in some regions. Finally Leroux suggests a number of priorities for climatologists to better understand processes of climate change, to integrate them into climate models, and to predict accurately future changes in climate. This timely and controversial book lays out the scientific case of the sizable skeptical scientific community who challenge the accepted wisdom.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e43de9bc96c90ff9feaf2d2c93ddb7ed0e6ec34c","amp;dn":"Global+Warming+-+Myth+or+Reality+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e43de9bc96c90ff9feaf2d2c93ddb7ed0e6ec34c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,61,233,188,150,201,15,249,254,175,45,44,147,221,183,237,14,110,195,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
