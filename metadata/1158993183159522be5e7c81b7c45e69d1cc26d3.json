A mysterious toxin in the water supply turns everyone exposed to it into mindless killers and the authorities leave the uninfected to their certain doom in this terrifying reinvention of the George Romero horror classic. Directed by Breck Eisner (Sahara), The Crazies is written by Ray Wright (Pulse, Case 39) and Scott Kosar (The Amityville Horror, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre). The American Dream goes horribly wrong when the residents of this pictureÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½perfect town begin to succumb to an uncontrollable urge for violence and the horrific bloodshed escalates into anarchy. In an attempt to contain the epidemic, the military uses deadly force to close off access into or out of town, abandoning the few healthy citizens to the growing mayhem as depraved killers lurk in the shadows. Sheriff David Dutton (Timothy Olyphant); his pregnant wife, Judy (Radha Mitchell); Becca (Danielle Panabaker), an assistant at the medical center; and Russell (Joe Anderson), DuttonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s deputy and rightÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½hand man, find themselves trapped in a once idyllic town they can no longer recognize. Unable to trust former neighbors and friends, deserted by the authorities and terrified of contracting the illness themselves, they are forced to band together in a nightmarish struggle for survival.\n\n\n\nCast:..........Timothy Olyphant, Radha Mitchell, Danielle Panabaker, Joe Anderson\nDirector:......Breck Eisner\nRelease Date:..February 26th, 2010 \n\n[Please seed]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1158993183159522be5e7c81b7c45e69d1cc26d3","amp;dn":"The.Crazies%5B2010%5D%5BBDRip%5D-Gkz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1158993183159522be5e7c81b7c45e69d1cc26d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,88,153,49,131,21,149,34,190,94,124,129,183,196,94,105,209,204,38,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
