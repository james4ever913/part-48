For the roguish yet charming Captain Jack Sparrow, the crystalline waters of the Caribbean, like the high seas the world over, present a vast playground where adventure and mystery abound. But Jack\\&amp;#039;s idyllic life capsizes after his nemesis, the wily Captain Barbossa, steals his ship, the Black Pearl, and later attacks the town of Port Royal, kidnapping the Governor\\&amp;#039;s beautiful daughter, Elizabeth Swann. Elizabeth\\&amp;#039;s childhood friend, Will Turner, joins forces with Jack to commandeer the fastest ship in the British fleet, the HMS Interceptor, in a gallant attempt to rescue her and recapture the Black Pearl. The duo and their crew are pursued by Elizabeth\\&amp;#039;s betrothed, the debonair, ambitious Commodore Norrington, aboard the HMS dauntless. Unbeknownst to Will, there is a curse that has doomed Barbossa and his crew to live forever as the undead--when exposed to moonlight, they are exposed to living skeletons. The curse they carry can be broken, only if a once-plundered treasure is restored.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4702297fccd5cf8ddc0a017d7dfa32a08fe1035","amp;dn":"Pirates+of+the+Caribbean%3A+The+Curse+of+the+Black+Pearl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4702297fccd5cf8ddc0a017d7dfa32a08fe1035","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,112,34,151,252,205,92,248,221,192,160,23,215,223,163,42,8,254,16,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
