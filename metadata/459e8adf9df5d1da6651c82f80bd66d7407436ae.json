The spark was ignited in the tiny village of Palenque, inhabited since the seventeenth century by Africans fleeing slavery, and their descendants. In Palenque, the traditional African rhythms and rituals survived unbroken, making the village a magnet that attracted not only lovers of music from the coastal regions. More recently, the advent of Cuban labourers brought Son Montuno to the region, while seamen from Africa introduced their old Highlife and Soukous records. A thrillingly revolutionary blend of styles was born. From its beginnings in the Black ghettos, Champeta has stormed throughout Columbia and beyond. The legendary percussionist and singer Batata is regarded as the King of Champeta. Exclusively for this major Network project, Batata and Lucas Silva invited to the studio the finest Cumbia musicians, brass players from the best bands, Highlife and Soukous guitarists, percussionists and the most talented of the animators who are such an important part of this music- that is an explosive burst of Creole Soukous, Columbian Highlife and tropical Afrobeat.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:459e8adf9df5d1da6651c82f80bd66d7407436ae","amp;dn":"Batata+-+King+of+Champeta+-+Radio+Bakongo+-+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"459e8adf9df5d1da6651c82f80bd66d7407436ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,158,138,223,157,245,209,218,102,81,200,47,128,189,102,215,64,116,54,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
