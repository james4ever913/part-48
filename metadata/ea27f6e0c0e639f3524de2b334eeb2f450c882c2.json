Three years later, she remains angry and alienated from her parents, especially her father ...until her mother decides it would be in everyone\\'s best interest if she spent the summer on Tybee Island with him. Ronnie\\'s father, a former concert pianist and teacher, is living a quiet life in the beach town, immersed in creating a work of art that will become the centerpiece of a local church. The tale that unfolds is an unforgettable story about love in its myriad forms - first love, the love between parents and children - that demonstrates, as only a Nicholas Sparks novel can, the many ways that deeply felt relationships can break our hearts ...and heal them.\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea27f6e0c0e639f3524de2b334eeb2f450c882c2","amp;dn":"The+Last+Song%5B2010%5DDvDrip-aXXo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea27f6e0c0e639f3524de2b334eeb2f450c882c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,39,246,224,192,230,57,243,82,77,226,179,52,238,178,244,80,200,130,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
