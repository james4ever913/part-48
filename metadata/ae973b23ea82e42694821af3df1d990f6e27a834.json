Roa-de-la-Carrera\nPublisher: University Press of Colorado\nDate: 2005-12-01\nFormat: pdf\nLanguage: English\nISBN10: 0870818139\nPages: 288\nISBN13: 9780870818134\n\nIn Histories of Infamy,  Cristian Roa-de-la-Carrera explores Francisco Lopez de GomaraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s (1511-ca.1559) attempt to ethically reconcile SpainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s civilizing mission with the conquistadorsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ abuse and exploitation of Native peoples.\n\nThe most widely read account of the conquest in its time, Gomara's Historia general de las Indias y Conquista de Mexico rationalized the conquistadors' crimes as unavoidable evils in the task of bringing &quot;civilization&quot; to the New World. Through an elaborate defense of Spanish imperialism, Gomara aimed to convince his readers of the merits of the conquest, regardless of the devastation it had wrought upon Spain's new subjects.\n\nDespite his efforts, Gomara's apologist text quickly fell into disrepute and became ammunition for Spain's critics. Evaluating the effectiveness of ideologies of colonization, Roa-de-la-Carrera's readable analysis will fascinate readers and scholars interested in the history of the Americas.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae973b23ea82e42694821af3df1d990f6e27a834","amp;dn":"Histories+of+Infamy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae973b23ea82e42694821af3df1d990f6e27a834","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,151,59,35,234,130,228,38,148,130,26,243,223,29,153,15,110,39,168,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
