After witnessing her mother's violent death at the hands of a pack of wolf shifters, Andie has devoted her life to protecting her community of cougar shifters from a similar fate. But now, a greater threat lies within her own dare, and she must run. If she stays, Kyle Carstairs will try to force their Mating, seeking the added power their union would provide.\n\nAndie would rather chew off her own foot than end up with Kyle. Though, knowing him, she won't live long either way. Andie's only hope of survival is to Mate the Alpha of the Keller Dare with which she is seeking asylum. But before she can get to him, Andie must first go through A.J., one of the Alpha's Protectors. The incredibly frustrating shifter insists on challenging her story, her skills, her trustÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and her heart.\n\nAndie is running out of options and out of time. But risking the life of someone she loves - just to save herself - goes against every instinct she has.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ccbc2a8ef4bf708511371ba2022b4891ad9acc18","amp;dn":"%5BShadowcat+Nation+01%5D+Andromeda%27s+Fall+by+Abigail+Owen+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ccbc2a8ef4bf708511371ba2022b4891ad9acc18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,188,42,142,244,191,112,133,17,55,27,162,2,43,72,145,173,154,204,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
