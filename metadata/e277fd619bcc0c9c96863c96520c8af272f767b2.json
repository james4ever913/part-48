Keanu Reeves stars as an LA Bomb Squad specialist whose principal antagonist is elusive bomber-extortionist Dennis Hopper. Seeking vengeance after his latest ransom scheme is thwarted, Hopper presents a personal challenge to Reeves: A wired-for-destruction city bus, which will detonate if the speedometer drops below 50 MPH. Playing the reluctant civilian who is pressed into service as the bus\\\\\\' \\\\\\&quot;substitute driver,\\\\\\&quot; leading lady Sandra Bullock became a major star in her own right. Once Speed gets to the meat of its story, the excitement never lets up--not even after the boobytrapped bus is out of the picture. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e277fd619bcc0c9c96863c96520c8af272f767b2","amp;dn":"Speed%281994%29BRip.AC3%28ENG%29-DROCK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e277fd619bcc0c9c96863c96520c8af272f767b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,119,253,97,155,204,12,156,150,134,60,150,82,12,138,242,114,247,103,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
