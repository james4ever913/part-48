Just select a photo and click Optimize. Suddenly a dull photo starts to shine. There's nothing to configure, you really just select and click. The results look attractive and natural, not artificially boosted. You can also optimize all your photos with a single click, it's just as easy as a single photo. Also correcting the dreaded red eye effect in flash photos is just as easy: Just roughly select the part of the photo containing the red eyes and click, Photo Optimizer does all the rest. You dont have to make a precise selection, the red area is found and corrected automatically. Here too, the result looks attractively natural and you get it instantly, without having to spend hours studying a manual.\n\n\nWindows Vista, Windows 95, Windows XP ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d706517dfc9b11fd946a2cfceb6db0206120584","amp;dn":"Photo+Optimizer+3.03-serial+incl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d706517dfc9b11fd946a2cfceb6db0206120584","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,112,101,23,223,201,177,31,217,70,162,207,206,182,219,2,6,18,5,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
