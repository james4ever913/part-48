It is commonly regarded as one of the Great American Novels, and is one of the first major American novels written in the vernacular, characterized by local color regionalism. It is told in the first person by Huckleberry &quot;Huck&quot; Finn, best friend of Tom Sawyer and narrator of two other Twain novels.\n\nThe book is noted for its colorful description of people and places along the Mississippi River. By satirizing a Southern antebellum society that was already anachronistic at the time, the book is an often scathing look at entrenched attitudes, particularly racism. The drifting journey of Huck and his friend Jim, a runaway slave, down the Mississippi River on their raft may be one of the most enduring images of escape and freedom in all of American literature.\n\nThe book has been popular with young readers since its publication and is taken as a sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.\n\n\nOriginally uploaded by Funnyguy263 and uploaded again with his kind permission. \nHope you enjoy this itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a fine book.
