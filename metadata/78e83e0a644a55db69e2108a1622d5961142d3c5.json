Jailbird has gone on to perform with the likes of The Roots, Digital Underground, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, the Luniz, Rob Base, DJ EZ Rock, The Souls of Mischief and the 2 Live Crew.\nJailbird&amp;#039;s media crtics claim he is better than Eminem, Paul Wall, Lil Wayne, Soulja Boy, 50 Cent, Snoop Dogg, Usher, Akon, Dr. Dre, Justin Timberlake, Tupac, 2Pac, and Lil Jon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78e83e0a644a55db69e2108a1622d5961142d3c5","amp;dn":"THE+GETAWAY+by+JAILBIRD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78e83e0a644a55db69e2108a1622d5961142d3c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,232,62,10,100,74,85,219,105,226,16,138,22,34,213,150,17,66,211,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
