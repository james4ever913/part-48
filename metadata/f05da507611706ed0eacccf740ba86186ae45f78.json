James Brown, who worked on the band's 2006 album Meds, engineered. It will also be the first album with the new drummer, Steve Forrest.\n\nOn Battle for the Sun, the band use new instruments, such as trumpets and saxophones. The material has influences from such bands as PJ Harvey and My Bloody Valentine. It is said to be a heavier-sounding record compared to its predecessor. Frontman Brian Molko said on the concept of the album:\n\nWe've made a record about choosing life, about choosing to live, about stepping out of the darkness and into the light. Not necessarily turning your back on the darkness because it's there, it's essential; it's a part of who you are, but more about the choice of standing in the sunlight instead.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f05da507611706ed0eacccf740ba86186ae45f78","amp;dn":"Placebo+-+Battle+for+the+sun+%5B2009%5D+%5BAC3+5.1%5D+%5BBubanee%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f05da507611706ed0eacccf740ba86186ae45f78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,93,165,7,97,23,6,237,14,172,204,247,64,186,134,24,106,228,95,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
