At that time, in May 2007, the iPhone had not yet arrived at market, the app ecosystem it would usher in was still gestating and the iPad was simply a long-running rumor.\n\nSo the conversation onstage focused largely on the iPod, iTunes and AppleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s (AAPL) relationship with the music industry, and the forthcoming launch of the iPhone. \n\nMuch has changed in three years. But one thing has remained constant: Apple, under Jobs, continues to drive innovation in every industry it touches.\n\n\n\nd8_all_things_digital_2010_steve_jobs_interview.mp4\nSize 220 MB\nLength 01:35:53\n\nVideo\nResolution 480 x 270\nAspect ratio 1.7778\nFormat H264\nBitrate 255 kbps\nFPS 29.970\n\nAudio\nFormat MP4A\nBitrate 63 kbps\nRate 44100 Hz\nChannels 2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82465090a7a41a33a4bd77d6dc465d36b517e1e4","amp;dn":"D8%3A+All+Things+Digital+2010%2C+Steve+Jobs+interview","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82465090a7a41a33a4bd77d6dc465d36b517e1e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,70,80,144,167,164,26,51,164,189,119,214,220,70,93,54,181,23,225,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
