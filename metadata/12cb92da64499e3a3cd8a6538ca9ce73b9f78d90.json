Mupen64Plus is a N64 emulator and plugins for Linux, Mac OSX, and FreeBSD. Mupen64Plus  is a plugin-based N64 emulator for Linux which is capable of accurately playing many games. Included are four MIPS R4300 CPU emulators, with dynamic recompilers for 32-bit x86 and 64-bit amd64 systems, and necessary plugins for audio, graphical rendering (RDP), signal co-processor (RSP), and input. There are 3 OpenGL video plugins included: glN64, RiceVideoLinux, and Glide64.\n\nMupen64Plus Features:\n* Dynamic recompilers for 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (amd64) machines\n* 3 OpenGL video plugins: glN64, RiceVideoLinux, Glide64\n* Hi-resolution texture support in Rice Video\n* LIRC Infrared remote control support\n* Rumble Pak support\n* Graphical R4300 debugger\n* Cheat system with gameshark code support\n* Speed adjustment with smooth sound output\n* GTK2-based GUI\n* Qt4-based GUI\n* Command-line options for integration into other systems\n* Installation support for multi-user systems\n\n// Source = http://code.google.com/p/mupen64plus/\n\n#Glitch64 SVN r110#\n\nGlitch64 SVN r110 is released.GlideHQ is a realtime texture enhancer library with hi-resolution texture pack support for Glide64.Glitch64 is the recommended Glide3x wrapper for Glide64, the Glide video plugin for N64 emulators. It currently supports S3TC texture compression, anisotropic filtering, widescreen resolutions and simulates almost all the Glide3x hardware capabilities used by the plugin, included texture buffer capability (needed for render to texture). It is coded using the OpenGL API and uses GLSL shaders.\n\nTraditional and non-traditional techniques have been used to achieve speed and high image quality even on a 9 year old 3Dfx Voodoo2. Although the 3Dfx Glide3x texture format naming conventions are used, the library can be expanded for generic use. The library supports 6 enhancers and 6 image filters. FXT1 and S3TC texture compression are supported.\n\nGlitch64 SVN changelog:\nr106\nCreated Internalization wiki page through web user interface.\nr107\nEdited wiki page through web user interface.\nr108\nInternalization support.\nr109\nAdded master message catalog and translation file for Russian.\nr110\nEdited wiki page through web user interface.\n\n// Source = http://code.google.com/p/glidehqplusglitch64/\n\n#1964 SVN r60#\n\n1964 SVN r60 is released.1964 is a free Open Source N64 Emulator.

Needs a video card which supports OpenGL 2.1-3.0\n* Modified the LFB writing code to use dirty rects for texture writing. (only writes the portions of the texture that have changed, a usual optimization technique when writing to 2D surfaces) Depth buffer code still uses glDrawPixels normally.\nTested with Beetle Adventure Racing, got consistent 60FPS with REFB on. Still, dunno if its placebo or not, due to I having a PCIE card.\n\n// Source = //\n\n#nGlide v0.92#\n\n#CuteMupen v0.0.6#\n\nCuteMupen v0.0.6 is released.
