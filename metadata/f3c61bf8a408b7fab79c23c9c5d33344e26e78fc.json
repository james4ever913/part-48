The show follows Mexican-born family patriarch and tequila entrepreneur Bill and his wife Lori, as they raise four beautiful daughters Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jen, Lauren, Jackie and Catherine Ã¢â‚¬â€œ while fighting to pass along traditional values of family and marriage when faced with the seductions of Hollywood lifestyle. The girls, all in their 20s, try to find their independence while facing questions of assimilation, boyfriends and dating, sibling rivalries and changing economic times for the family. The show spotlights the dynamics and drama of being a Marin, which can be explosive and combative at times, but always rooted in love.\n\n\nJen celebrates her birthday with a lavish party and receives a surprise from her boyfriend in a sneak peek of this reality show about a wealthy California tequila entrepreneur struggling to let go of his independent-minded daughters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3c61bf8a408b7fab79c23c9c5d33344e26e78fc","amp;dn":"Tequila.Sisters.S01E01","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3c61bf8a408b7fab79c23c9c5d33344e26e78fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,198,27,248,164,8,183,250,183,156,35,201,197,211,51,68,226,110,120,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
