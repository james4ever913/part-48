You get the functionality of a loop editor or digital audio workstation, but you can blend songs together to create stunning DJ performances.\n\nMixMeister Fusion frees you from monotonous tasks like beat matching, setting cue points, and counting beats in your head. It gives you the power to unleash your creativity and shape your music in a million ways, with live looping and remixing, VST effects, harmonic mixing and more.\n\nYou can manipulate tempo, volume, and EQ in real time, on-the-fly. It even records all your actions (not just the resulting audio), so you can go back, listen to your mix, and make precise adjustments with studio-style editing capabilities.\n\nFusion&amp;#039;s live performance capabilities can be expanded via connectivity with MIDI hardware controllers. Export your completed mix as an MP3 or burned to a CD using the integrated burning tools. Whether you use it for live gigs or mix CD production, Fusion lets you achieve true performance perfection.\n\n\n\njust install and enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6f65c6e1a5290274ebdecad971fd45d0936f7c7","amp;dn":"mixmeister+fusion+v+7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6f65c6e1a5290274ebdecad971fd45d0936f7c7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,246,92,110,26,82,144,39,78,189,236,173,151,31,212,93,9,54,247,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
