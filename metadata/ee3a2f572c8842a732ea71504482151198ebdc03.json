Anthony Lowe (Jean-Claude Van Damme) is a heroin-addicted detective attempting to take down the city&amp;#039;s most powerful drug lord. His life is in shambles, his wife is pregnant with another man&amp;#039;s child, and when the bust goes awry, two of his fellow officers end up dead as Lowe lies in a hospital bed hovering between life and death. Miraculously, Lowe eventually wakes up from his trauma-induced repose. While he once thought his life couldn&amp;#039;t get any worse, however, the ailing detective is shattered to learn that the very same men he had nearly died attempting to apprehend have kidnapped his wife. Now left with nothing to lose and every reason to live, the same man who had once written his own life off determines to rescue his wife and ensure that justice is served no matter what the cost. ~ \n\n\n                                       SEED ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee3a2f572c8842a732ea71504482151198ebdc03","amp;dn":"UNTIL_DEATH%28kontundir%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee3a2f572c8842a732ea71504482151198ebdc03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,58,47,87,44,136,66,167,50,234,113,80,68,130,21,17,152,235,220,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
