Jailbird, in his own words, considers himself, the thinking mans rapper, delivering more than just hard lyrics. I want to give people something to think about, something that will stay with them.\nJailbird has a strong performance background dating back to his first show in which he mesmerized over 500 people at the age of 14. Jailbird has gone on to perform with the likes of The Roots, Digital Underground, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, the Luniz, Rob Base, DJ EZ Rock, The Souls of Mischief and the 2 Live Crew.\nJailbird&amp;#039;s media critics claim he is better than Eminem, Paul Wall, Lil Wayne, Soulja Boy, 50 Cent, Snoop Dogg, Usher, Akon, Dr. Dre, Justin Timberlake, Tupac, 2Pac, and Lil Jon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9db171c6baf944f8eda9f414ce84498f3f945066","amp;dn":"U+KNOW+IT+by+JAILBIRD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9db171c6baf944f8eda9f414ce84498f3f945066","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,177,113,198,186,249,68,248,237,169,244,20,206,132,73,143,63,148,80,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
