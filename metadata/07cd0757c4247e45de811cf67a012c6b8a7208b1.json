Scopes in the Scopes Trial (1925), in which he opposed William Jennings Bryan (statesman, noted orator, and three time presidential candidate for the Democratic Party). Called a &quot;sophisticated country lawyer&quot;, he remains notable for his wit and agnosticism, which marked him as one of the most famous American lawyers and civil libertarians.\n\nToday, Clarence Darrow is remembered for his reputation as a fierce litigator who, in many cases, championed the cause of the underdog; because of this, he is generally regarded, for better or worse, as one of the greatest criminal defense lawyer in American history.\n\nAfter his death, a full-length one-man play was created, Darrow, featuring Darrow's reminiscences about his career. Originated by Henry Fonda, many actors, including Leslie Nielsen, have since taken on the role of Darrow in this play.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07cd0757c4247e45de811cf67a012c6b8a7208b1","amp;dn":"Clarence+Darrow++%28TV%29+%5B1974%5D+Henry+Fonda","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07cd0757c4247e45de811cf67a012c6b8a7208b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,205,7,87,196,36,126,69,222,129,28,246,122,1,44,107,138,114,8,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
