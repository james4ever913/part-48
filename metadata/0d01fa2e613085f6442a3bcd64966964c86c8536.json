Years later, G Baby, as his family called him, made his own way from the rough streets of Toronto's Jamestown Crescent neighbourhood to the oilfields of Alberta looking for riches and good fortune. There, he died and his murder remains unsolved, like so many other murders of young Somali-Canadians. The extra twist in this case: some members of his family are convinced they know who committed the crime.\n\nHear from the family of Abdinasir Dirie as the fifth estate explores the searing pain of their struggle and peels back the layers of a story even more complicated than anyone originally expected.\n\nFile Information\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 422 MiB for 45mn 0s 657ms\nSource            : CBC HD\nCodec             : XviD\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 170 Kbps\nAspect            : 624 x 352 (1.773) at 29.969 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 128 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d01fa2e613085f6442a3bcd64966964c86c8536","amp;dn":"the_fifth_estate.S36E06.05.Nov.2010.PDTV.XviD-Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d01fa2e613085f6442a3bcd64966964c86c8536","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,1,250,46,97,48,133,246,68,42,59,205,100,150,105,100,200,108,133,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
