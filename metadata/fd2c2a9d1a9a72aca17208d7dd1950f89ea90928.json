Releasing this, their debut album in -89, basically playing traditional thrash, their future didnÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´t look so bright as Death Metal were conquering the world as the new extreme. Also, they didnÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´t release any other album after this one. Still, this is a really great album and as far as iÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´m concerned, a dark horse with some really great tracks. This isnÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´t brutal thrash a la Slayer or Dark Angel, but with some really great riffing and some original ideas here and there, sometimes sounding like Anthrax or later Death Angel. \n\nEnjoy and please help me seed after download.\n\n\n\n\nMore of my uploads - http://thepiratebay.se/user/pentry1973/j2cvi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd2c2a9d1a9a72aca17208d7dd1950f89ea90928","amp;dn":"Thrash+Metal+%2F%2F+Faith+or+Fear+-+Punishment+Area+%28-89%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd2c2a9d1a9a72aca17208d7dd1950f89ea90928","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,44,42,157,26,154,114,172,161,114,8,215,221,25,80,248,158,169,9,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
