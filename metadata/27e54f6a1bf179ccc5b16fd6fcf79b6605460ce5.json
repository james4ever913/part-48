Though some of those tracks were available on singles or compilations, there are a few which haven't been made available on any other official release.  For long I wanted to do it, I've ripped each bonus tracks from those albums and compiled in this release.  The artistic quality goes from crap to absolute brilliant, but at last, they're all together on the same place... and loseless! ;)\n\nI've seperated them on 2 CDs, though as you can imagine, it's only a matter of space and CD-R.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27e54f6a1bf179ccc5b16fd6fcf79b6605460ce5","amp;dn":"Queen+-+Hollywood+Bonus+Tracks+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D+%5BRePoPo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27e54f6a1bf179ccc5b16fd6fcf79b6605460ce5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,229,79,106,27,241,121,204,197,177,111,214,252,247,155,102,5,70,12,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
