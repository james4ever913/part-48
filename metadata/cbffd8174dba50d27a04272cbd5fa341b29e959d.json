Still, Lawn Chair Society's greater emphasis on electronics will no\ndoubt come as a surprise to those who know him through solo piano outings like\nLive at Maybeck Recital Hall (Concord, 1994) or the more recent post-bop of\nDemocracy: Live at the Blue Note (Half Note, 2006). With its combination of\nstrong group interplay, electronica textures and occasional post-Miles musings,\nLawn Chair Society simply confirms that Werner is an artist for whom the words\nconvention and predictability have no meaning.\n\nWhich really shouldn't come as a surprise, given that Werner literally wrote the\nbook (Effortless Mastery) on channelling one's technical knowledge into a\nconsistently fresh approach.\n\nLawn Chair Society reconvenes Democracy's rhythm sectionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½bassist Scott Colley\nand drummer Brian Blade. By enlisting trumpeter Dave Douglas and saxophonist\nChris PotterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½two artists who have on their own recordings been exploring paths\nof technology integrated with improvised musicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Werner has built a quintet quite\nliterally capable of anything. And it's a good thing, because Lawn Chair Society\nattempts to cover a lot of stylistic and textural ground.\n\nElectronic sounds bubble underneath and, occasionally, come to the surface on\ntracks like &quot;Lo's Garden,&quot; whose theme could easily be transposed into a\nstraight-ahead context if it weren't for Colley's staggered support and Werner's\nfluidly abstract lines. The post-Herbie Hancock funk of &quot;New Amsterdam&quot; is\nequally elastic, with Blade's busy groove propelling it forward even as, midway\nthrough, the time suddenly shifts into a visceral swing.\n\n&quot;Lawn Chair (and Other Foreign Policy),&quot; later in the disc, seems like a return\nto the same funk, with Douglas' introductory solo leading into the kind of\nsing-song melody so characteristic of Miles Davis' later years (think\n&quot;Jean-Pierre&quot;). But it's Werner's harmonic shuffling underneath that\ndemonstrates the potential of even the simplest of lines to yield worthwhile\nresults. From visceral groove to the spacious abstraction of Werner's solo and,\nultimately, to harmonized textures referencing &quot;It's About That Time&quot; from\nMiles' classic In a Silent Way (Columbia, 1969), it's a brilliant piece of\nmusical history-telling that, with producer Lenny Picket's ambient ideas weaving\nin and out, remains thoroughly modern.\n\nThe playing is as interactive and inventive as one would expect from a group\nthis strong. What makes Lawn Chair Society more than just another all-star\nsession is the conceptual aesthetic that links seemingly disparate tunes, as the\nconnection between the melancholy closer, &quot;Kothbiro,&quot; with the processed sounds\nsurrounding Douglas' free-ranging solo on the aptly titled\n&quot;burble_burble_splerk.&quot; Werner's unexpected shift may rankle some purists, but\nit's a demonstration that the best artists refuse to be pigeonholed by\nexpectations arising from past successes, which instead become little more than\nsteps in a constantly evolving creative process of discovery and innovation.\n\nPublished: May 13, 2007\nStyle: Modern Jazz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbffd8174dba50d27a04272cbd5fa341b29e959d","amp;dn":"Kenny+Werner+-+Lawn+Chair+Society+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbffd8174dba50d27a04272cbd5fa341b29e959d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,255,216,23,77,186,80,210,122,4,39,44,189,95,163,65,178,158,149,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
