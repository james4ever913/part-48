Now, the six-piece ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Matt Sessions, J.C. Chan, Jason Grissinger, Justin Robertson, Ryan Ratfield and Molly Kaplan ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ are prepared to show the world another facet of pop with their digital- and vinyl-only debut, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œVaudevilleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.  If Neil Young were reborn as a Gen Y-er influenced by aughts-era smart indie rock and Wilco, he'd probably sound like Sons of August.\n\nAt first, some songs seem hopelessly romantic (Winter Horoscopes, Fermenting on a Screen). But just when listeners are ready to fall head-first into SessionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ earnest voice, the sounds of the mandolin become fueled by electric guitars pluck them out of their starry-eyed state.  Other songs (Cameo Rodeo, Soldiers) are reminiscent of the Replacements with a good dose of twang, accordion and harmonica, then balanced out with female vocals and backed with male harmonies.  And some songs were meant to played loud, like Sunday Vendetta, where the violin crashes down on your ears just as easily as the drums and guitars take over.  One thingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s for sure: As the last notes of Burning Your Favorite Bridges come to a close, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll leave you hanging for the bandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s next act.\n\n\n1.
