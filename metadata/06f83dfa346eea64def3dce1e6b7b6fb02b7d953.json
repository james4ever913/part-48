The show features the adventures of Bob and Doug and their friends in the Canadian town of Maple Lake and beyond.\n\nBob &amp; Doug is based on the hit Canadian cult classic The Great White North&quot; (originally known as &quot;Kanadian Korner&quot;) which coined the phrase ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Eh?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œhoser.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nBob &amp; Doug takes place in the fictional town of Maple Lake, a typical suburban Canadian town, which lies across the river from a typical American city, JFK City and a few miles west of Toronto. Maple Lake is a pastoral, idyllic representation of a typical Canadian suburb. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s what the Americans think Canada is like.
