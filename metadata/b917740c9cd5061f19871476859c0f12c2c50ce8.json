Songs like the title track and &quot;I'll Be Home for Christmas&quot; might not have the same impact now as they did in the days of life during wartime, but Presley's voice can still elicit an ache or two with its delivery. Despite the fact that some viewed him as a sexual threat, there was often an innocence in his songs. That innocence shows nicely in &quot;Winter Wonderland,&quot; while &quot;O Come All Ye Faithful&quot; is Elvis at his holiday best. Blue Christmas is probably the best of Presley's offerings of the season\n[IMG]http://i896.photobucket.com/albums/ac169/pbf99/tr.gif[/IMG]\n   1. Winter Wonderland (2008)\n   2. Blue Christmas\n   3.
