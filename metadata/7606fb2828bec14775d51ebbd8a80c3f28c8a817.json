Not only it includes Hangman but it also has a soundcheck\n at the beginning of the CD! It's superb to hear parts of various songs during the soundcheck (e.g. Ogre Battle without Brian\n's guitar etc.) Quality is very good minus. I compiled this CD from several bootlegs so you get the best quality available \n(Supporting Mott The Hoople bootleg has worse quality than most of this).\n\n   1. Soundcheck: Guitar Intro/Ogre Battle/Procession/Father to Son/Procession/Son and Daughter/Guitar Bits/\n                  Bama Lama Bamma Loo/Keep Yourself Alive\n   2. Procession\n   3. Father to Son\n   4. Son and Daughter\n   5. Ogre Battle\n   6. Hangman\n   7. Keep Yourself Alive\n   8. Liar\n   9. Jailhouse Rock\n  10. Shake, Rattle &amp; Roll\n  11. Stupid Cupid\n  12. Be Bop A Lula\n  13. Jailhouse Rock reprise\n  14. Bama Lama Bamma Loo \n\nLength: 63 min\nLine up: Freddie Mercury, Brian May, John Deacon, Roger Taylor.
