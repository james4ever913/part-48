From the great mathematician Al-Khwarizmi, who did much to establish the mathematical tradition we now know as algebra, to Ibn Sina, a pioneer of early medicine whose Canon of Medicine was still in use as recently as the 19th century, he pieces together a remarkable story of the often-overlooked achievements of the early medieval Islamic scientists.\n\nComplete All 3 episodes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:435b1959c86a3be14b334e7c1193dd5639ece0d5","amp;dn":"Science+and+Islam.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"435b1959c86a3be14b334e7c1193dd5639ece0d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,91,25,89,200,106,59,225,75,51,78,124,17,147,221,86,57,236,224,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
