Unfortunatly i couldn't install decent drivers for my old 5900XT so it wouldn't go higher than 800x600 in crap mode... (sigh) - so watch out if you have an old nVidea card.\n\nI'll seed most days from about 2pm to 11pm GMT\n\n\n:-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b386dabf0badad063d0d834089c07287cfa26a8","amp;dn":"Ultimate+Ubuntu+2.0+GAMERS+x86+%28official%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b386dabf0badad063d0d834089c07287cfa26a8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,56,109,171,240,186,218,208,99,208,216,52,8,156,7,40,124,250,38,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
