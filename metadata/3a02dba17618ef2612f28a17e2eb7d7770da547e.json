No, not videos ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ 8-track tapes, like from the 70ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s. Audio only. No, not recordings of porno movie soundtracks. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s like porno for the blind, or X-rated radio theater: improbable scenarios, occasional sound effects, awkward play-by-play of all the action. Arousing? Stilted? Downright hilarious? You decide.\n\nLike many of the real gems in my audio holdings, I acquired this from Goldmine Records, Columbus Ohio. I need to take a few moments here to briefly canonize Goldmine and especially GoldmineÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s owner, Joe (both RIP). Goldmine for me wasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ wellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ a goldmine: it was nearby, it was cheap, and good stuff came through regularly. Joe was just right for it. Half rock casualty, half Simpsons comic book guy, Joe was a Zappa-worshipping music lover who ran this store for MEN. And not just all men: the list of people who had been kicked out of the store and banned for life was not short. The infraction could be anything from questioning ZappaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s genius (the signed show poster behind the counter shouldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve warned you) or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œusing the lordÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s name in vainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ as a hand-written notice near the Zappa poster warned. JoeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s appreciation for Zappa wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t just in life ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he died the same way as Zappa, too (prostate cancer).\n\nAlthough I was never big Zappa fan or even for most of JoeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s likes, he took a shining to me. I think he simply understood that even though I appreciated confusing things like inappropriate religious records and other shitty sounds, I liked what I liked, and I liked it hard and by the dozen. And he gave me quantity discounts on those dozens, for which I am so grateful that IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll spend paragraphs canonizing him on a blog. (Record stores, take noteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦)\n\nThese six 8-tracks were no exception. Joe held these for me at the store and left one of his characteristically gruff messages on my answering machine to get over there. Mouth agape, I inspected these 8-track treasures while he went on about how amazing they were, how rare they were, how heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d never seen anything like them before. I was bracing myself for the worstÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAlright JoeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ how much?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œEh ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ dollar each.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nI miss Joe.&quot;\n\nEnjoy.
