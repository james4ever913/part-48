Jackson composed the lyrics while Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis composed the music, which featured a sample from Sly &amp; the Family Stone&amp;#039;s 1969 song &quot;Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)&quot;. The song preached racial unity and harmony among nations and in promise of &quot;looking for a better way of life&quot; and a way to stop &quot;social injustice.&quot; The song became as famous for its countdown in both the song and the video as it was for its message. It peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Billboard Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs during late 1989 and early 1990. It was also the song preceding Justin Timberlake&amp;#039;s &quot;Rock Your Body&quot; that would unfold into the infamous Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy.\n\nThe song inspired the name of English DJ Trevor Nelson&amp;#039;s BBC Radio 1 show &quot;Rhythm Nation&quot;. Nelson told Jackson this during their 1998 interview which aired on the same show. The show also spawned several compilation albums under the same name.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07598818874c95d38c29c4ca4f8a101242b75f66","amp;dn":"Janet+Jackson+-+Rhythm+Nation+%28Live%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07598818874c95d38c29c4ca4f8a101242b75f66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,89,136,24,135,76,149,211,140,41,196,202,79,138,16,18,66,183,95,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
