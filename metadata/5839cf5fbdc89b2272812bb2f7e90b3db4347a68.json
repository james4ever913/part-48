With fresh, you get hit and miss, but the few hits end up being something worth stashing in the permanently library. &quot;ANTHEM RAVE&quot; and &quot;Dragunova&quot; are clearly the hits, &quot;Another Mind&quot; is pretty good I guess. If you're looking for something out of the ordinary, give it a shot.\n\nPretty cool album cover too.\n\n\n01. ANTHEM RAVE - wint vs. kors k\n02. Dragunova - Yuji.M\n03.
