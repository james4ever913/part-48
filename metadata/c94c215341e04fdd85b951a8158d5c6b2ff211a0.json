It was the first single released off her second studio album, Hearts in Armor.\n\n&quot;Wrong Side of Memphis&quot; was written by Garry Harrison and Matraca Berg. The song tells the story of a woman who lives in Memphis, Tennessee and has decided to take control of her life and leave Memphis and move to Nashville, Tennessee where she can fulfill her dream of becoming a Country music singer. The woman explains how she is going to leave Memphis in the chorus of the song:\n\n        &quot;I've been living on the wrong side of Memphis\n        Really breaking away this time\n        Full tank of gas and a '69 Tempest\n        Taking me to that Nashville sign.&quot;\n\n&quot;Wrong Side of Memphis&quot; was released in late 1992, and became a Top 10 hit, peaking at #5 on the Billboard Country Chart by the end of the year. It was the most successful solo single off of Yearwood's Hearts in Armor. The album was released following the single's release.\n\nAlthough Yearwood is mainly known for her Pop-styled ballads, &quot;Wrong Side of Memphis&quot; is one of the few songs she has released that is considered up-tempo and twangy. The music video for &quot;Wrong Side of Memphis&quot; was released following the single's release and debuted on CMT in 1992.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c94c215341e04fdd85b951a8158d5c6b2ff211a0","amp;dn":"Trisha+Yearwood+-+Wrong+Side+Of+Memphis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c94c215341e04fdd85b951a8158d5c6b2ff211a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,76,33,83,65,224,79,221,133,185,81,168,21,141,92,107,47,242,17,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
