When America sits down to watch\nprimetime television it expects to see more than stereotypes\nand stock characters going through the motions. Primetime\nviewers want to see the United States of Television - in all\nits individuality, diversity, eccentricity and quirkiness.\n\nThat's how some of the most high-risk characters in the primetime\ncrowd are born. These are the awkward squad - the ones who can't,\nor won't, or aren't allowed to fit in: nerds, geeks, freaks,\nrebels, outsiders and misfits. Characters like Gomez Addams in\nThe Addams Family, Louie DePalma in Taxi, George Costanza in\nSeinfeld and practically the whole cast of Glee. But though they\nmay march to a different drummer, in primetime they become 'one\nof us' - and we, whether we like it not, become one of them.\n\nFeaturing interviews with stars, creators, writers and producers\nincluding Judd Apatow (Freaks and Geeks), Danny DeVito (Taxi),\nGarry Shandling (The Larry Sanders Show), Jason Alexander (Seinfeld)\nand the crown-prince of misfits, Larry David.\n\n**********\n\nSize: 577,007,616 bytes (550.277 MB)\nPlay duration: 00:57:32\nXviD\nac3\nDigital Cable HDTV\n\n**********\n\nTHIS IS MY OWN DIGITAL CABLE HDTV RECORDING AND ENCODE.\n\nIF YOU WANT THE INFERIOR X264 VERSION, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.\n\nDON'T COMPLAIN.
