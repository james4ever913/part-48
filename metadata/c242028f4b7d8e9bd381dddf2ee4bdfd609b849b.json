Its a bit like writing a script. \nSometimes you can sit there for three hours with your guitar and nothing will happen. \nThen in the last ten minutes something will spark. \n\nTO LOVE SOMEBODY\n________________\n\nWe originally wrote this song for Otis Redding while we were staying at the St Regis\nhotel in New York. Then, of course, he died in a plane crash. We were huge admirers \nof his, so we decided to record it ourselves. It is one of our most covered songs. \nI like our version the best, but then IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m biased. I think Nina SimoneÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cover is \nfantastic too.\n\nI STARTED A JOKE\n________________\n\nThis is a very spiritual song, the listeners have to interpret it themselves ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ \ntrying to explain it would detract from the song. \nIt got to number five in the US, but it wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t released in the UK as a single. \nFaith no More covered it as their final single as a band.\n \nNIGHTS ON BROADWAY\n__________________\n\nThis was produced by Arif Mardin, it was a huge hit for us in the States and has been\ncovered a heck of a lot since then, it was the first song Barry introduced his famous \nfalsetto vocals on, which became an important part of our sound for many years.\nLike a lot of artists, such as McCartney and Prince, we were experimenting. It was \nimportant to us as songwriters as well, we didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t want to stick to a certain formula.\n\nHOW CAN YOU MEND A BROKEN HEART\n_______________________________\n \nThis was our second number one in the States after a two year split, the first number\none was Lonely Days, and we wrote both singles in the same afternoon in our basement\nflat in Addison Road in Kensington, it was a happy time ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ any time we reunite is happy.\nBarry and I dont really speak about the split, we focus on being back together because \nthats what were all about.\n\nRUN TO ME\n_________\n\nWe wrote this is at our manager Robert Stigwoods house in Beverly Hills, he was a great \nvisionary and championed our beliefs and chemistry as brothers, if he hadnt got in touch \nwith us when we arrived back in the UK from Australia our career could have gone a \ndifferent way entirely, we are always in and out of Los Angeles.\n\nNEW YORK MINING DISASTER 1941\n_____________________________\n\nWe recorded this at Londons IBC studio because it was dark and emulated a mining shaft. \n\nThe result was a very lonely sound, it was our first UK and US single after meeting \nRobert Stigwood and our first hit on both sides of the Atlantic, We had been making \nrecords in Australia but this was a notch up, it was a great buzz.\n\nMASSACHUSETTS\n_____________\n \nThis was a bittersweet victory, the day it went to number one it was Bonfire Night and I \nwas in the Hithergreen Rail Crash in Lewisham, Forty-nine people died and it was one of \nBritains worst rail disasters, luckily I didnt get injured. I remember sitting at the side \nof the carriage, watching the rain pour down, fireworks go off and blue lights of the \nambulances whirring, it was like something out of a Spielberg film.\nI thought, at least there is one consolation, we have our first UK number one.\n\nCLOSER THAN CLOSE\n_________________\n\nThis is very special to us, as Maurice sings the main vocals, it is taken from the One \nNight Only album and was never released as a single, we performed it at the Brit Awards \nin 1997, when we won a Lifetime Achievement Award. \nThis is a dedication to him. Although we lost Maurice in 2003 his legacy lives on in \nour music. Turn on the radio, you hear the song and hes there.\n\nHOW DEEP IS YOUR LOVE\n_____________________\n\nThis was the first of six consecutive number ones in the States. Nobody had ever done \nthat before and very few people have done it since, at one stage there were around seven \nof our songs ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ which we had either sung or written for other people ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ in the US Billboard \ntop ten. It doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t get much better than that. If you accomplish half of what we have \nyoure happy.\n__________\n\n 1) Jive Talkin\n\n 2) Nights on Broadway\n\n 3) Ive Gotta Get A Message To You\n\n 4) To Love Somebody\n\n 5) Words\n\n 6) I Started A Joke\n\n 7) How Can You Mend A Broken Heart\n\n 8) Run To Me/World\n\n 9) New York Mining Disaster\n\n10) Massachusetts\n\n11) Closer Than Close\n\n12) How Deep Is Your Love\n___________\n\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFile size                        : 10.0 MiB\nDuration                         : 4mn 22s\nOverall bit rate                 : 320 Kbps\nAlbum                            : Bee Gees Greatest Hits - Mail On Sunday\nTrack name                       : Jive Talkin'\nTrack name/Position              : 1\nPerformer                        : Bee Gees\nWriting library                  : LAME3.98.2\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                   : Version 1\nFormat profile                   : Layer 3\nFormat_Settings_Mode             : Joint stereo\nDuration                         : 4mn 22s\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 44.1 KHz\nResolution                       : 16 bits\nStream size                      : 10.0 MiB (100%)\nWriting library                  : LAME3.98.2\n__________\n\nMp3\n\nRipped:320\n\nEnjoy:D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c242028f4b7d8e9bd381dddf2ee4bdfd609b849b","amp;dn":"Bee+Gees+-+Live+2009+%28Promo-The+Mail%29%28mp3+320kbs%29ICM369","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c242028f4b7d8e9bd381dddf2ee4bdfd609b849b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,66,2,143,75,125,142,155,211,129,221,223,46,228,189,253,96,155,132,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
