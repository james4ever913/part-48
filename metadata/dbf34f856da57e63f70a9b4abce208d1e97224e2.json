He is for many blues lovers the favorite unknown bluesman in Chicago. His guitar style is a cross between Magic SlimÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s stinging leads and Magic SamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s cool little rhythm fills while his great singing doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t really sound like anyone else.\nIn 1958 SmilinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Bobby started to play music in clubs and playing at Maxwell Street Sunday mornings beginning around 1961 or 62. He became a close friend to Magic Sam and used to hang around at his house. SmilinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Bobby got his nickname around 62 or 63 because he was always grinning so much. He was influenced by Jimmy Reed and Willie Mabon, also Little Milton, Albert Collins and Albert King. His guitar style is not Delta Blues it is much more modern, somewhere in between RÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“B and Chicago Blues.\nHe is now 69 years old and his son Carlos Showers is another great guitar player who played in Willie KentÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s band the Gents. \n\nHis debut album presents Chicago Blues at its best!\n\n1.
