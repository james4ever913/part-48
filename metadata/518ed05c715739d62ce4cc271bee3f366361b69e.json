The format of the program combined commentary on media and current events with viewer contributions and activities. \n\nIt is considered one of the most influential series in the history of vlogging because of its pioneering nature and for inspiring many of the elements which now define the genre. \n\nIt also inspired many of today's most popular vloggers, including the Vlogbrothers, Philip DeFranco and Wheezy Waiter. It was the subject of articles in Slate, The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, The Guardian, and Newsweek.&quot;\n\nThis torrent is the full corpus of the show (247 episodes), web ripped in .flv format at 240px (because that's as big as things got back then). \n\n\nIf you like it, or if you want better quality or a different format, consider making a donation at http://store.zefrank.com/?page=store&amp;contentId=Donation.35-45","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:518ed05c715739d62ce4cc271bee3f366361b69e","amp;dn":"The+Show+with+Ze+Frank+%282006-2007%29+%5BFIXED%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"518ed05c715739d62ce4cc271bee3f366361b69e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,142,208,92,113,87,57,214,44,228,204,39,27,238,63,54,99,97,182,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
