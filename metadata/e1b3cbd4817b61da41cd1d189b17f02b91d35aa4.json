If YOU chose to use this firmware, you\nmust remember that it is YOU taking the risks. You can not approach\nPopcornhour, or Syabas with your troubles. You will not be able to\nreach me.\n\nThe primary goal of this alternate firmware was to enable DTS decoding\non A-100. But we felt we might as well add a few more things.\n\nHere it how it works, when you flash this on a A-100, it will become\nan A-110. This means future firmware updates will be as a A-110. You\nshould hold back with upgrading to newer firmwares in case Syabas\ndecides to do something to detect alternate firmwares.\n\nWe have included return firmwares so you can restore your Popcornhour\nto original firmware.\n\nA-100 : POP402\nA-110 : POP403\nB-110 : POP405\n\n\nAlternate firmware changes:\n\n* DTS\n* telnetd\n* Network settings tweak\n* FUSE loaded\n* ntfs-3g binaries for mounting NTFS read/write\n* Additional busybox26 utilities\n\n\nIf there are other changes you would like done, let us know. If there\nare other player and model versions you would like done, let us know.\n\nGood luck.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1b3cbd4817b61da41cd1d189b17f02b91d35aa4","amp;dn":"Shifted-01-17-081023-15-POP-403.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1b3cbd4817b61da41cd1d189b17f02b91d35aa4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,179,203,212,129,123,97,218,65,205,29,24,155,23,240,43,145,211,90,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
