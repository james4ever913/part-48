The second is the current state of the Country Music industry. With Nashville as a hub, these two conversations create a coherent theme.\n\nWith respect to family, we see Jennings embracing his bloodlines in a manner that is uncommon for artists who are the progeny of legends. Typically the children of famous entertainers either distance themselves from their parents (often to the point of disdain), or crumble under the weight of their name. To the contrary, Shooter Jennings seems proud of his legacy, and uses his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dogged independence to give the finger to the current Country Music establishment. On Ã¢â‚¬ËœOutsiderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ he compares his outlaw spirit to his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I am the outsider. A horse with no riderÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. The real stab at the current landscape of Country Music comes on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Outlaw YouÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, on which he taunts , Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hey pretty boy in your baseball hat. You couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hit Country with a baseball batÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. He also references his father, who in the early 70Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“busted down the doorÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and busted the formula of the Nashville record executives. On the same song, he fast forwards to today as he bemoans that Ã¢â‚¬Å“All these years later the suits got back their gripÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“The Other LifeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, does not get bogged down in the politics of Country Music History. There is a balanced mix of Outlaw Country and Rock. He also is joined by other singers such as Patty Griffin (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wild and LonesomeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and Scott H. Biram (Ã¢â‚¬Å“The White Trash SongÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½). With his own vision of the future and a nod the past, we see Shooter Jennings standing above the crowd as he hits his stride.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:894e0d7b5d8e835781e860b95fb986203109e4a5","amp;dn":"Shooter+Jennings+-+The+Other+Life+%5B2013%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"894e0d7b5d8e835781e860b95fb986203109e4a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,78,13,123,93,142,131,87,129,232,96,185,95,185,134,32,49,9,228,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
