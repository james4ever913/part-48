Prominently featured is a member of the \nChippewa Cree tribe known as &quot;Weasel,&quot; a meth user for half of his 22 years who lives with his addict father \nand whose girlfriend had her two children taken away because of meth use. \n\nThe cheapness and availability of meth - which one Montana tribal leader describes as an epidemic - is taking a huge toll \non the local Native American population. Montana Meth explores the physical and psychological damage caused by \nthis particularly vicious drug, whose effects range from tooth decay and skin lesions to brain damage and death. \nIt also shows law enforcement and the justice system's efforts to grapple with the magnitude of the problem.\n\nDirected by Eames Yates, Produced by Eames Yates and John Loeffler.\n\nThe executive producer of Montana Meth is Thomas Siebel, whose foundation, \nThe Thomas and Stacey Siebel Foundation, has also funded the companion public \nawareness and meth prevention campaign, The Montana Meth Project.\n\nScreenshots :\n[url]http://shup.com/Shup/408272/Montana.Meth.DSR.XviD.TiCKT0K.avi_thumbs_%5B2010.08.28_13.42.45%5D.jpg[/url]\n\nSource: DSR TV RiP\nDuration= 00:59:33\nResolution= 640 x 480\nFile size= 681mb\nFile Container= .avi\n\n\n\n\nENJOY ~ TiCKT0K Torrents","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdb7aa7015003fc3aebc06e5df4a3a925cc0c660","amp;dn":"Montana.Meth.DSR.XviD.TiCKT0K","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdb7aa7015003fc3aebc06e5df4a3a925cc0c660","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,183,170,112,21,0,63,195,174,188,6,229,223,74,58,146,92,192,198,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
