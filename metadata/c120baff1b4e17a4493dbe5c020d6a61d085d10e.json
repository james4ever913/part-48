Despite the occasional use of wah-wah pedal guitars in &quot;I Typed for Miles,&quot; which sounds almost identical to Nirvana's &quot;Heart Shaped Box,&quot; Jets to Brazil live up to their hype. Most of the songs clock in at an epic length while containing storytelling lyrics with Blake Schwarzenbach's (formerly of Jawbreaker) trademark raspy vocals. Mood swings also accompany the sound of Orange Rhyming Dictionary, which can move from laid-back and gloomy too upbeat and not as gloomy, all in a good sort of way though.
