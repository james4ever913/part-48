Miller's untimely death in 1944, at the height of his popularity, cut short what would have been a great career. But when Miller died in the line of duty (he was an officer in the Air Force), he left behind an incredible body of work, totaling hundreds of recordings, that continued to move and entertain a generation of Americans.\nCompiling 60 great songs, THE POPULAR RECORDINGS bears witness to his genius. All the favorites are here, including &quot;Danny Boy,&quot; &quot;Rhapsody in Blue,&quot; and the unforgettable &quot;Moonlight Serenade.&quot; Of course, no Glenn Miller collection would be complete without &quot;In the Mood&quot; and &quot;Star Dust,&quot; both included here.\n\nDISC 1:\n1.
