In 1650, plantation slaves revolt and head for the mountains where they find others led by the aged seer, Acotirene. She anoints one who becomes Ganga Zumba, a legendary king. For years, his warriors hold off Portuguese raiders; then he agrees to leave the mountains in exchange for reservation land and peace. It\\'s a mistake. Zumbi, a warrior whose mother was killed by Portuguese and who spent 15 years with the Whites, stays in the mountains to lead Palmares. In 1694, the Portuguese import a ruthless captain from SÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â£o Paulo to lead an assault on the free Blacks. Can Zumbi keep Palmares free?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a78ca577450fff38c491bf7b7934a0d5014a2b64","amp;dn":"Quilombo+%281984%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a78ca577450fff38c491bf7b7934a0d5014a2b64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,140,165,119,69,15,255,56,196,145,191,123,121,52,160,213,1,74,43,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
